## 1. The problem, in plain language

You've just calibrated a stormwater model for a city drainage review. The
simulation takes 4 minutes to run. The report is due tomorrow. Everything is
ready — except a nagging question keeps surfacing in the back of your mind:

*What is Manning's n, really, for that stretch of aging concrete-and-gravel
channel in the north-east catchment?*

The 2019 field survey said 0.015. The textbook range for that surface type is
0.012–0.018. Nobody measured it directly; someone eyeballed it and moved on,
which is exactly what happens to roughness coefficients, soil infiltration
rates, and a dozen other parameters in every model ever built. If the true
value is 20% higher than what you assumed, how much deeper does the flooding
get at the critical junction downstream? How confident should you be in the
100-year design flow?

**The textbook answer** is Monte Carlo: run the model 50 times with Manning's n
randomly perturbed each time, and look at the spread of results. Fifty runs at
4 minutes each is over 3 hours. You don't have 3 hours.

**What most engineers actually do** is run the model once and add a footnote:
*"Manning's n carries inherent uncertainty; results should be interpreted with
appropriate engineering judgment."* This sentence is honest. It is also
completely unquantified — it tells the reviewer nothing about *how much*
judgment to apply, or *where*.

**What the uncertainty sidecar does** is give you the Monte Carlo answer at
roughly Monte-Carlo-for-free prices. Not an approximation of the answer, not a
statistical shortcut that trades accuracy for speed — a genuinely different way
of solving the *same* linearized equations that makes the extra 49 simulations
cost about two seconds instead of three hours.

## 2. The big idea, in one sentence

> **A pipe network — or a 2D flood surface — only has a few independent ways it
> can wobble, and if you track the wobbles instead of every individual pipe or
> grid cell, uncertainty propagation becomes almost free.**

That's it. Everything else in this document is working out what "wobble"
means precisely, how many of them there are, and how cheap "almost free"
actually turns out to be (spoiler: about 2 seconds of extra compute on a
4-minute, 8,000-node real-city simulation).

## 3. Three metaphors to build intuition

### 3.1 The weather forecast — an ensemble of possible futures

You've seen hurricane "spaghetti plots" — dozens of thin colored lines
fanning out from the storm's current position, each one a different plausible
future track. No single line is "the forecast." The *bundle* of lines is the
forecast: where they all agree, confidence is high; where they diverge,
confidence is low.

The uncertainty sidecar builds the same kind of ensemble for a drainage
network, except instead of 50 different possible storm tracks, it runs 50
different possible values of Manning's n (or rainfall depth, or both) *at the
same time*, alongside your one real simulation. Every one of those 50
"members" is a slightly different parallel universe: what if n were 0.0122
here? 0.0179 there? Sort the 50 depth values at each node and each moment in
time, and you get a band — the 5th-to-95th percentile of the members — exactly
like a spaghetti plot's shaded cone. (Whether that band is a *calibrated* 90%
interval is a separate, measured question; see "What the band promises" below.)

The catch with real weather ensembles is that each of the 50 forecast members
is a *full, independent run of the entire climate model* — expensive. The
sidecar's trick is making its 50 members cost almost nothing, which is where
the next metaphor comes in.

### 3.2 The guitar string — why a network only has a few "notes"

Pluck a guitar string and it doesn't vibrate randomly. It rings with a
fundamental tone, plus an octave above, plus a fifth above that, each fainter
than the last. Physicists call these **modes**: characteristic *shapes* the
string is "allowed" to vibrate in, each with its own natural frequency. To
predict how the string responds to any pluck, you don't need to track the
position of every atom along its length — you only need the amplitude of the
first handful of modes. High-frequency modes die out almost instantly; only
the low ones persist.

A water surface in a drainage network behaves the same way. If you perturb
the depth somewhere and watch how the disturbance spreads and settles, it
doesn't just diffuse randomly — it decomposes into a small number of
characteristic spatial *shapes*, each with its own decay rate. These shapes
are called **eigenmodes**, and they come from a matrix called the **graph
Laplacian**, built purely from *which nodes are connected to which* (plus, for
the more refined version, *how strongly* — a big pipe couples its neighbors
more tightly than a small one).

- **The smoothest possible shape** (mode 0, the *constant* shape — everything
  moves up or down together) doesn't spread information anywhere; it's
  excluded from the analysis.
- **The next-smoothest shape** (called the *Fiedler mode*, after the
  mathematician who studied it) identifies the network's tightest hydraulic
  bottleneck — the pump station or narrow trunk line where the network is
  closest to splitting into two disconnected halves. (SWMM6 actually exposes
  this as a diagnostic: `FiedlerDiagnostic`/`FiedlerDiagnostic1D` rank every
  node by how much it sits on that bottleneck.)
- **Higher shapes** capture increasingly fine, local spatial detail, and decay
  faster and faster.

Retaining the first `k=10` shapes out of a network with `n=8,000` nodes
compresses the state needed to describe uncertainty by roughly 800×. That
compression is the entire reason this is fast.

### 3.3 The stratified raffle — why the sampling isn't just "50 random dice"

If you draw 50 random numbers to represent 50 possible Manning's-n values,
plain bad luck can leave big gaps — maybe none of your 50 draws land anywhere
near the extreme low end of the plausible range, so your uncertainty band is
artificially narrow exactly where it matters most for a worst-case flood
check.

The sidecar instead uses **Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**: it slices the
plausible range `[1 − p, 1 + p] × base value` into exactly 50 equal-width
strata and puts exactly one ensemble member in each stratum. Think of it as a
raffle where you're guaranteed one ticket sold in every price bracket — no
clustering, no empty gaps, full coverage of the range with the minimum
possible number of draws. This is the classic statistical reason LHS
converges faster than plain random (Monte Carlo) sampling for the same
ensemble size.

A second, related design choice: if you draw Manning's-n strata and
rainfall-depth strata independently but both happen to be sorted the same
way, the two "random" parameters end up perfectly *correlated* by accident —
member 1 always gets the lowest Manning's n *and* the lowest rainfall,
member 50 always gets the highest of both. That silently narrows your
apparent uncertainty, because the two effects always point the same
direction instead of sometimes canceling. The sidecar's LHS design
deliberately shuffles the assignment of strata to members independently for
each parameter, so that low-Manning's-n members are just as likely to get
high rainfall as low rainfall.

## 4. The math, built up gently

Everything below is the *exact* mathematics running inside
`SpectralROM` (2D) and `SpectralROM1D` (1D) — not a simplification for the
sake of exposition. If you follow this section start to finish, you will
understand precisely what the code computes.

### 4.1 Warm-up: a single leaky bucket

Before tackling a whole network, consider the simplest possible drainage
system: one bucket, filling from a tap at rate `f`, draining through a hole
at the bottom at a rate proportional to how full it is (`rate × level`).
That's a first-order linear ODE:

```
dlevel/dt = −rate · level  +  f
```

If `f` and `rate` are constant, this equation has an exact, closed-form
solution — no numerical timestepping needed, no approximation:

```
level(t+dt) = (level(t) − f/rate) · exp(−rate · dt)  +  f/rate
```

The bucket approaches a **steady state** of `f/rate` and decays toward it
exponentially. This is precisely the mathematics of a rain barrel filling and
draining, and it is also — surprisingly — *precisely* the mathematics that
governs every single eigenmode of an entire drainage network. Every mode is
its own independent leaky bucket.

### 4.2 From one bucket to a whole network: the graph Laplacian

For a 1D pipe network, build a matrix `L` — the **graph Laplacian** — where:

- The diagonal entry for node `i` is the sum of the conductances of every
  pipe touching node `i`.
- The off-diagonal entry `L[i,j]` is `−(conductance of the pipe between i and
  j)` if such a pipe exists, or `0` otherwise.

`L` fully encodes the network's *shape*: which nodes talk to which, and how
strongly. The linearized diffusion-wave equation for how head deviations
spread through the network is:

```
dh/dt = −K1d · L · h  +  f
```

where `h` is the vector of head deviations at every active node, `K1d` is an
effective conductance (derived from Manning's n, slope, and depth — see
`computeK1d()`), and `f` is the forcing (inflow, rainfall-driven change).
This is the *network-wide* version of the leaky bucket — except now `h` has
thousands of entries and this is thousands of coupled equations, which is
exactly the problem the eigenmode trick solves.

*(The 2D surface-flow case uses the same structure, with `L` built from mesh
cell adjacency instead of pipe connectivity, and Manning's-n-dependent
conductance weighting the mesh edges.)*

### 4.3 Projecting onto eigenmodes — turning thousands of equations into a handful

`L` has eigenvectors `P[:,0], P[:,1], ..., P[:,n-1]` and eigenvalues
`λ_0 ≤ λ_1 ≤ ... ≤ λ_{n-1}` (this is the same eigendecomposition behind the
guitar-string metaphor in §3.2). Compute the coefficient `a_j` — "how much of
shape `j` is present in the current head field" — by projecting:

```
a_j = P[:,j]^T · h        (a dot product: "how much does h look like shape j?")
```

Crucially, because `L` is symmetric, its eigenvectors are *orthogonal*: the
evolution of `a_j` depends only on `a_j` itself, not on any of the other
modes. The single giant network equation decomposes into `k` completely
independent scalar ODEs — one leaky bucket per retained mode:

```
da_j/dt = −λ_j · K1d · a_j  +  r_coarse[j]

where r_coarse[j] = P[:,j]^T · f      ("how much of the forcing hits shape j")
```

This is exactly the bucket equation from §4.1, with `rate = λ_j · K1d` and
`f = r_coarse[j]`. Retaining `k=10` modes out of `n=8,000` nodes means
tracking 10 independent bucket equations instead of 8,000 coupled ones — a
computational reduction of nearly three orders of magnitude, *before* even
getting to the ensemble.

> **Why this doesn't lose accuracy where it matters**: the low-order modes
> (smooth, network-scale shapes) are exactly the ones that persist and matter
> for flood-depth uncertainty; the high-order modes (sharp, local, cell-scale

> member's uncertainty, not its total value, evolves relative to that real
> deterministic answer. §4.4 makes this precise.

### 4.4 Making it an ensemble — tracking the *deviation*, not the total

Call the real, live deterministic depth (or head) field `h_det` — the number
SWMM's ordinary solver computes every routing step regardless of whether the
sidecar is even switched on. Each ensemble member `i` doesn't track its own
independent total depth; it tracks only how far its sampled Manning's-n
multiplier `mannings_mult[i]` and rainfall multiplier `rainfall_mult[i]`
(drawn from the Latin Hypercube design in §3.3) pull it away from `h_det`.
Project that *deviation* onto the eigenmodes exactly as in §4.3:

```
δa[i,j] = P[:,j]^T · (h_i − h_det)      ("how much member i's deviation looks like shape j")

b_j     = P[:,j]^T · h_det              ("how much of the real deterministic answer is shape j")
```

The deviation for mode `j`, member `i` obeys its own leaky-bucket equation:

```
d(δa[i,j])/dt = −rate[i,j] · δa[i,j]  +  g[i,j]

rate[i,j] = λ_j · K1d / mannings_mult[i]

g[i,j] = −λ_j · K1d · (1/mannings_mult[i] − 1) · b_j     (Manning sensitivity)
         + (rainfall_mult[i] − 1) · r_coarse[j]           (forcing sensitivity)
```

The key feature: for the member with `mannings_mult[i] = 1` and
`rainfall_mult[i] = 1` — the "nominal" member sitting exactly at the
calibrated parameter values — every term in `g[i,j]` vanishes. Its deviation
is *exactly zero, forever*: that member's reconstructed depth is always
identical to the real deterministic answer, not merely close to it. Every
other member's deviation measures, precisely, how much its particular
Manning's-n or rainfall guess would have changed the outcome.

Each of the `M × k` mode-member pairs is *still* a leaky bucket with an exact
closed-form solution — the same equation from §4.1, applied independently to
every (member, mode) pair:

```
steady[i,j]     = g[i,j] / rate[i,j]
δa[i,j](t+dt)   = (δa[i,j](t) − steady[i,j]) · exp(−rate[i,j] · dt)  +  steady[i,j]
```

This is **not an approximation of the ODE — it is its exact solution**, for
any timestep `dt`, however large. There is no substepping, no Newton
iteration, no Krylov solve, no CFL-style stability limit. Advancing the
entire ensemble for one timestep costs `M × k` multiplications and
exponentials — for `M=50, k=10`, about 500 floating-point operations,
something a modern CPU does in under a microsecond. Compare that to the
deterministic CVODE solver's nonlinear residual evaluations across every one
of the network's thousands of nodes on every routing step, and the reason the
sidecar is nearly free becomes a matter of simple arithmetic, not a clever
approximation.

### 4.5 Reading out the answer — reconstructing depths and taking quantiles

At any moment, reconstruct member `i`'s full head field by adding its
deviation, summed back through the eigenvector shapes, onto the real
deterministic answer:

```
h_i[node t] = h_det[node t]  +  Σ_j  δa[i,j] · P[j, t]
```

Do this for all 50 members at node `t`, sort the 50 resulting numbers, and
read off:

```
q05  =  the 5th-percentile value  (5% chance the true depth is lower)
q50  =  the median value          (the "best single guess")
q95  =  the 95th-percentile value (5% chance the true depth is higher)
```

**What the band promises (status 2026-10-05).** `[q05, q95]` is the 5th-to-95th
percentile of the ensemble, which would be a 90% prediction interval *if* the
ROM reproduced the brute-force spread exactly. It does not everywhere. Measured
against brute-force Monte Carlo (VALIDATION.md, "Interval-coverage audit"), the
fraction of true outcomes inside the band ranges from 0.83 (front passage) and
0.82 (2D production operator) down to 0.76 (soft rain), 0.51 (surcharged pipes)
and 0.20 (an unreachable-regime fixture). The project's rule (C1 + C2): a cell is
**calibrated** when that fraction is ≥ 0.80 *and* the band is no more than
1.5× the brute-force width on median; ≥ 0.80 but wider than that is
**conservative** (right place, too wide); below 0.80 its band is **ranking
only** — it reliably shows *where* uncertainty concentrates and *which* nodes
are more uncertain than others, but its width is not a probability. Each
ranking-only cell has a named fix PR. Read every band in this guide as a
ranking unless VALIDATION.md marks that regime calibrated.

## 5. A worked example with real numbers

Abstract equations are easier to trust once you've seen them run on a real
network. SWMM6's uncertainty sidecar has been benchmarked on **StormCity**, a
real-scale synthetic network with **8,267 junctions, 1,132 outfalls, and
6,968 conduits**, driven by a 6-hour SCS Type II design storm at a 0.5-second
timestep (43,200 routing steps).

**Cost.** The deterministic baseline run — no uncertainty tracking at all —
took 2,124 seconds (about 35 minutes). Turning on the uncertainty sidecar
with a **50-member ensemble and ±20% Manning's-n uncertainty** brought the
total to 2,171 seconds: **a 2.2% overhead** for 5th-to-95th percentile bands at
every one of 8,266 nodes, at every report timestep, for the entire 6-hour
storm. (That figure is the 1D Manning path with comonotone coherence; the
correlated soft-rain path costs more per step — about 10× the comonotone
advance on a 9,800-cell 2D profile mesh, VALIDATION.md "CL-2a" — and the
StormCity bands themselves are ranking-only, not calibrated; see above.) A brute-force Monte Carlo equivalent — 50 full deterministic reruns —
would cost roughly **50× the baseline**, or nearly 30 hours.

**Result.** Output from this same StormCity uncertainty-benchmark setup (50
members, ±20% Manning's n) shows the physically expected pattern:

- **During the storm's rising limb** (roughly 29–57 minutes in), the
  uncertainty band widens rapidly as depths climb fast and Manning's-n
  differences between ensemble members compound — peak spread of about
  0.35 ft observed at storm onset.
- **The largest single spread observed anywhere in the simulation** was about
  4.4 ft, at a downstream junction during the storm's peak, exactly where
  you'd expect roughness uncertainty to matter most — a node experiencing
  rapid, large head changes where small differences in conveyance capacity
  compound into large depth differences.
- **The trunk mainline** (large-diameter pipes carrying most of the flow)
  showed comparatively small spread — under 0.1 ft — because large pipes are
  proportionally less sensitive to Manning's-n uncertainty than the small
  laterals feeding them. This matches physical intuition: roughness matters
  more when a pipe is nearly full and friction-dominated than when it's
  running at low relative depth in an oversized conduit.

A smaller-scale controlled comparison confirms the raw speed claim directly:
on a 50×50 mesh, computing the full uncertainty ensemble via the eigenmode
ROM (`k=10` modes, `M=20` members) took **4 milliseconds**. Running the
equivalent 20-member brute-force Monte Carlo ensemble — 20 full deterministic
solves — took **3,705 milliseconds**. That's a measured **~900×** speedup for
an apples-to-apples comparison on identical hardware, identical network,
identical parameter ranges.

## 6. Reading the output

At every active node, at every report timestep, the sidecar writes three
numbers instead of one: `q05`, `q50`, `q95` (in a `<report>.uncertainty.csv`
file for the 1D network, or as extra fields in the 2D output for surface
flooding). Here's how to read them:

- **`q50` (median) is your best single estimate** — treat it the way you'd
  treat the ordinary deterministic result, because for a well-behaved
  symmetric perturbation it's very close to the deterministic run itself.
- **The width `q95 − q05` is a direct measure of how much the answer at that
  location depends on the uncertain parameter.** A wide band at a specific
  junction is the model telling you: *"this location's flood risk is
  sensitive to exactly the parameter you're uncertain about — go get better
  field data here before you finalize the design."* A narrow band elsewhere
  says the opposite: *"even a 20% error in Manning's n barely moves this
  number — don't waste calibration effort here."*
- **Bands widen during rapid change and narrow during steady state.** This is
  physically correct, not an artifact: uncertainty in a rate parameter (like
  Manning's n) only matters while something is actively changing. A pipe
  sitting at dry-weather steady flow doesn't care much what Manning's n is;
  a pipe surging through a storm peak cares a great deal.
- **Spatial spread patterns are diagnostic, not just decorative.** Nodes with
  disproportionately wide bands relative to their neighbors are exactly the
  nodes a Fiedler-mode bottleneck analysis (§3.2) tends to flag — narrow
  throats and pump stations where the network's hydraulic capacity is most
  finely balanced.

## 7. Why this is genuinely new

SWMM has existed for roughly fifty years. Uncertainty quantification in
stormwater modeling is not a new research topic — so why does a
model-integrated ROM sidecar feel like a genuine advance rather than a
repackaging of known techniques?

**Existing methods run *outside* the solver.** Monte Carlo, First-Order
Second-Moment (FOSM) analysis, and Morris sensitivity screening all work by
running the complete deterministic solver many times and comparing the
outputs afterward. They're accurate, well-understood, and expensive — and
because they treat the solver as a black box, they produce no per-timestep
uncertainty bands without saving and post-processing entire ensembles of full
simulation output. The sidecar runs *inside* the solver, advancing its
50-member ensemble in lockstep with the deterministic solution, reading the
solver's live internal state every routing step.

**Reduced-order modeling isn't new either — but not applied here before.**
Galerkin projection and proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) reduced-order
models have been used in river and coastal shallow-water modeling since the
early 2000s, almost always as *offline surrogates*: build a library of
full-model snapshots, fit a surrogate to that library, then query the cheap
surrogate for new inputs instead of rerunning the expensive full model. What
SWMM6 does differently is: (1) it computes its eigenbasis directly from mesh
or network *topology*, with no snapshot library required; (2) it runs as a
*live sidecar* alongside the solver, not as an offline replacement for it;
and (3) it handles the specific mess of real urban drainage — wet/dry
transitions, coupled 1D pipe and 2D surface flow, thousands of irregular
nodes — that idealized river and coastal test cases don't have to deal with.

**The 1000× speedup crosses a practical threshold.** At 10× faster than
brute-force Monte Carlo, uncertainty quantification is marginally more
attractive than the status quo. At 100×, it becomes viable for careful
research studies. At roughly 1000× — the regime this sidecar operates in —
uncertainty quantification becomes **operationally free**: a 4-minute
calibration run gains a full uncertainty band for well under a second of
extra compute. That's the difference between "something a PhD student runs
once for a paper" and "something that's on by default in every production
run," and it's the threshold that actually changes engineering practice.

---

## 8. Honesty corner — what it can't do yet

An accurate picture of any tool includes its edges.

**A band is the wrong summary when the ensemble splits in two.** If some
members surcharge a pipe and others don't, the ensemble isn't a fuzzy blob
around one answer — it's two distinct groups. Reporting that as
`q05/q50/q95` is actively misleading: the median lands between the clusters
and gets read as "the central estimate" while a large share of the members
are nowhere near it. The sidecar now detects this (a cheap gap statistic on
the sorted member values, plus a requirement that at least a fifth of members
sit on each side so one stray member doesn't count as a second group) and
raises `modality_flag` in `<rpt>.rom_threshold.csv`. When it is set, read
`p_exceed` — the *fraction of members that cross the threshold* — instead of
the band. This is the honest response to the objection that a linear model
can't represent branching behaviour: it can't, so it reports the probability
of the branch rather than pretending to a single smooth interval.

**A perfectly uniform perturbation produces no visible spread — but only on a
network with no outlet at all.** *(This limitation used to be much broader;
it has since been largely fixed, and the paragraph below is kept because the
reasoning is still worth understanding.)*
This sounds paradoxical, so it's worth explaining precisely why. Recall from
§3.2 that the "everything moves together" mode (mode 0, the constant shape)
is deliberately excluded — every mode the ROM actually tracks is a shape
that goes up in some places and down in others, never a shape that's
perfectly flat everywhere. If the starting condition (or the rainfall
forcing) is *exactly the same everywhere in the network*, there's genuinely
no spatial pattern for those shapes to grab onto — every one of the retained
modes projects to zero, the same way you can't tell whose stopwatch is more
accurate if neither stopwatch has started ticking yet. Every worked example
and default demo in this codebase deliberately uses a spatially-varying
starting condition or forcing (a localized bump, alternating high/low
rainfall cells) for exactly this reason — real storms and real terrain are
never perfectly uniform, so this rarely bites in practice, but a
perfectly-uniform synthetic test case can be genuinely misleading about how
much uncertainty is "really" there.

**What changed.** The escape hatch is the outlet. If the network drains
somewhere — any outfall, any open boundary — that exit can be treated as a
fixed reference the water is measured against ("grounding"), and once there
is a fixed reference, "everything rises together" stops being invisible: it
becomes "everything rises together *relative to the outlet*", which is a
perfectly ordinary shape the retained modes can represent. Both the 1D
network and the 2D surface do this by default now, and each has a test
asserting that a uniform field really does project non-trivially. So the
limitation as originally written no longer applies to normal models — a
uniform storm on a network with an outfall produces spread just fine. What
survives is the genuinely closed case: a model with no outlet anywhere, where
there is nothing to ground against. If you see suspiciously zero spread, the
first thing to check is whether the model actually drains somewhere.

**Band widths degrade near peak flow, and now there's a signal for when.**
The linearized weighted-Laplacian operator the ROM builds is *symmetric* by
construction — the underlying Picard solve applies one dQ/dH value per
conduit antisymmetrically to its two endpoints, so there is no directional
asymmetry for the ROM's basis to represent. The real Saint-Venant Jacobian,
by contrast, picks up genuine asymmetry from advective (inertial) terms as
flow speeds up — terms the linearized surrogate drops entirely. That gap
scales with the square of the Froude number, so bands quoted at or near
critical flow (Fr approaching 1) should be read with some skepticism; bands
in slow, subcritical reaches are unaffected. The engine now computes and
reports this directly (PR H3): `fr_trust` in `<rpt>.rom_diag.csv` is a
flow-weighted mean squared Froude number over the network at each report
time, clamped so a single fast trickle can't dominate the reading.
Interpretation: `fr_trust ≲ 0.05` means bands are trustworthy as reported;
`0.05–0.15` suggests inflating widths mentally by roughly 10%; `≳ 0.25`
means you're in the degraded peak-flow regime, where band widths can be off
by 10–25%. The same file's `surcharge_frac` column is the complementary
signal: once a reach surcharges, velocities collapse toward zero (Fr → 0)
and the symmetric surrogate becomes *more* accurate again, not less — so a
high surcharge fraction is not itself a trust concern.

**The Manning channel is scaled by the local head's elasticity to n, and
surcharged nodes get the pressurised value (PR H5b).** The ROM's
Manning-sensitivity source assumes head moves one-for-one with roughness.
It does not: a free-surface normal depth goes as `n^0.6`, and a pressurised
pipe's friction head as `n^2`. The sidecar now multiplies each node's source
by that exponent — 0.6 in free surface, blending to 2.0 as the node crosses
its crown — instead of the earlier "damp it toward a floor" rule (PR H5),
which had the sign of the correction backwards at the pool (surcharged heads
are *more* sensitive to n, not less). Measured against brute-force Monte
Carlo: the surcharged nodes themselves are now right (width ratio 1.02 at
the deepest pool node, member coverage 0.84 over the surcharged chain under
`NODE_CONTINUITY SEMI_IMPLICIT`), and the free-surface fixture went from
~2× over-wide to calibrated.

**The operator is now one-way across supercritical reaches (PR H14).** The
symmetric operator described above relayed a surcharged pool's deviation
*upstream* across a 5 % supercritical reach into nodes the pool cannot
physically influence — 7–15× over-wide there on the test chain, and not the
source term (zeroing it changed nothing). The sidecar now reads each
conduit's Froude number from the solver and, above Fr ≈ 1 (a smooth ramp
over 0.8–1.2), removes the upstream node's coupling to its downstream
neighbour while keeping the reverse. Nothing about the steady band changes
(the deviation form's fixed point does not depend on the operator); what
changes is that an upstream node now follows its own local physics while
the pool fills, instead of the pool's transient. Measured against the
Monte Carlo on the surcharged chain under `NODE_CONTINUITY SEMI_IMPLICIT`:
member coverage 0.83, width ratio 1.21 — calibrated — with the nodes above
the pool at ~1× instead of 7–15×. **Under `EXPLICIT`** the discrete
surcharge branch also drowns the node just upstream of a chokepoint, which
a rule keyed on that node's own depth cannot see; EXPLICIT's surcharged
bands improved (member coverage 0.69 → 0.73) but remain a documented
limitation. **If you expect appreciable, sustained surcharge, run with
`SEMI_IMPLICIT`.** `surcharge_frac` (above) tells you when you are in that
regime at all; `fr_trust` tells you how much of the network the gate is
acting on.

**The 2D band's 1.3× is two errors cancelling (H13, 2D half).** The 2D
Manning source has the same elasticity-1 assumption the 1D source had
before H5b (sheet-flow depth actually moves as n^0.6), so its fixed point
is 1.67× the physical band; the retained eigenmodes capture only ~0.8 of
the depth field at the default mode count, and the product is the measured
1.32. `MANNING_ELASTICITY 0.6` removes the first error but exposes the
second unless `MODES` is raised to a few percent of the cells. On a
converging channel the pooled numbers suggested a different elasticity;
binned by depth (W4b) the Monte Carlo's elasticity is Manning's 0.4–0.6 in
every class, and what is wrong is the reconstruction: a 2 cm film next to a
40 cm thalweg is handed a share of the thalweg's absolute deviation by the
smooth global modes, several times its own depth. The deviation lives in
absolute depth; a depth-relative deviation (`δ ln d`) would not leak
magnitude across a depth contrast — candidate H16. The default stays 1.0,
documented as what it is.

**A filling front's arrival TIME used to be invisible to the band — this is
now substantially fixed in 1D.** Everything in §4 tracks an *amplitude*: how
far a member's head deviates from the deterministic run at the SAME instant
in time. A front arriving a few minutes early or late is a different kind of
uncertainty — a shift along the time axis, not a shift in value — and no
amount of amplitude spread can represent it. Validation measured this
directly: at front passage, the pre-H11 amplitude-only band was roughly
150× too narrow (median width ratio 0.009) against brute-force Monte Carlo,
which naturally captures timing spread because every member is a genuinely
separate simulation. The fix (PR H11) gives each ensemble member its own
small time offset, `τ_i = (mm_i − 1)·T̄(x)`: a member with a larger Manning's
n conveys more slowly, so its signal at any given point arrives later by an
amount proportional to how much slower it is and how far that point is from
the source (`T̄(x)`, the deterministic travel time, computed from the
network's own current flow velocities — not assumed or hand-tuned).
Reconstructing that member's head then samples the deterministic run's own
history a little earlier or later instead of at "now." Re-measured against
the same brute-force MC design on a dedicated front-passage fixture: median
width ratio went from 0.009 to 1.354 (1.295 after the 2026-10-04 MC-quantile correction; empirical member coverage 0.83), comfortably inside the same acceptance
band H5 and PR-10 use — with the underlying physical constants left at their
design-time defaults, no calibration against this specific result. Two
properties worth trusting rather than taking on faith: (1) a member with
`mm_i = 1` (the nominal member) always has zero time offset, so the median
still tracks the deterministic run exactly, exactly as everywhere else in
this document; (2) once a network settles into steady state, every member's
time-shifted reference converges to the SAME value the unshifted reference
would have given, so this mechanism adds width only during an actual
transient — it does not silently widen every band forever. **Scope**: 1D
only. The 2D surface has the identical timing gap — measured separately as
the drain-to-pond limitation in `docs/uncertainty/VALIDATION.md`'s 2D
solver-mode-compatibility section (coverage 0.55–0.60) — and remains open. A
travel-time *field* rather than a single deterministic path would be needed
there, which is more involved than the 1D path-integral approach used above.

## 11. Supplying your own rainfall distributions (soft rainfall)

The "soft rainfall" feature is a different way to think about rainfall
uncertainty. Instead of sampling a scalar multiplier that applies uniformly
to all rain, you supply a **location-scale family** per gage or per grid cell:

- The deterministic rain IS the location parameter (the median / center).
- You supply only the **spread** (standard deviation, CV, or half-range).
- The ROM propagates the spread through its modal ODE using the
  two-projection form `f_ij = r_loc[j] + c_i · r_spread[j]`, where `c_i` is
  the family-selected per-member coefficient:
  - **NORMAL / LOGNORMAL**: `c_i = z_i = probit(u_i)` (standard-normal quantile)
  - **UNIFORM**: `c_i = 2·u_i − 1` (centered half-range band)

where `u_i = shuffledStrata(M, seed+4)[i]` — the same Latin-hypercube strata
the ROM already uses for Manning's n and other parameters, just with a
different seed offset (+4) so rainfall and roughness are decorrelated.

**The key insight** (the "location-parameter move" from the design doc): you
don't need to materialize an ensemble of rainfall fields. The deterministic
rain is the location; the spread is a single per-cell/plane field that the ROM
projects once per step. Member `i`'s realized forcing is
`loc + c_i · spread` — computed on demand inside the ROM's advance, never
stored as an M×N array. This is 50× smaller than a materialized ensemble.

**How to use it**: see `[SOFT_RAINGAGES]` and `[SOFT_RAINFALL_GRID]` in
`USER_GUIDE.md` §11. The pybme round-trip example
(`scripts/uncertainty/pybme_soft_rain_example.py`) shows the full workflow:
synthetic gages + radar → BME posterior → HDF5 grid file → engine run →
uncertainty band plot.

**MIXED family**: when a grid file declares `family=MIXED`, each cell carries
its own distribution family via a `/family_code` uint8 plane. The ROM accepts
**one spread plane per family** (PR H7): the caller splits the source by
`/family_code` — family A's cells in one plane with zeros elsewhere, family B's
in a second plane with zeros elsewhere — and `advance()` projects both, giving
each plane its own per-member coefficient:

    g_ij  +=  c_i · (Pᵀ·spread_A)_j  +  c_i^B · (Pᵀ·spread_B)_j

so every cell keeps its own family's marginal shape. Both coefficient columns
are drawn from the same `u_i` stream, so one rank per member still holds across
families — comonotone coherence is preserved by construction, not by a
convention that could drift. This replaces the earlier v1 approximation, which
used the NORMAL coefficient for every cell and pre-scaled UNIFORM cells' spread
by the coefficient range ratio (≈3.0) to match band *width* while distorting
the marginal *shape*.

Two caveats. First, per-family planes are a `COHERENCE FULL` feature:
`COHERENCE CORR_LEN` carries one family per source by construction, so
CORR_LEN × MIXED is refused with an explanatory error rather than approximated
(see `VALIDATION.md`, "True per-family coefficient planes"). Since PR SP3 that
refusal is raised at initialization, for gages (mixed families on one network)
and for grids (`family=MIXED` file), and `initialize()` returns the error. Second, the 2D grid
`/spread` → ROM wiring that supplies the two planes is in place (PR SP2): the
router maps `/spread` to the mesh, routes each cell to plane A (NORMAL/LOGNORMAL)
or plane B (UNIFORM) by `/family_code`, and installs both on the 2D ROM each
step. Single-family files pass a null second plane and are bit-identical to the
pre-H7 call.

**Deprecation note**: the scalar `RAINFALL` parameter in `[UNCERTAINTY]`
(which applies a single multiplier to all rainfall) is superseded by soft
rainfall for new work. The scalar path remains functional for backward
compatibility.

### 11.1 Joint vs. marginal correlation — the comonotone vs. spatial choice

**The comonotone path (default — `COHERENCE FULL`)** is the simplest case:
each member `i` has one scalar coefficient `c_i` that applies everywhere. The
per-cell ensemble at location t is `{loc[t] + c_1·spread[t], loc[t] + c_2·spread[t], ...}`.
Since all members scale the spread by the *same* amount, the *spread map itself*
defines the joint structure — if cell A has twice the spread of cell B, then A's
ensemble is twice as wide as B's. The marginals (per-cell distributions) are
correct, and the joint structure is **perfectly correlated across space**: members
move together everywhere.

**The spatially-correlated path (`COHERENCE CORR_LEN <meters>`)** lets each
member have a *different* coefficient at each location: `c_i[t]`. The per-cell
ensemble at location t is `{loc[t] + c_i1[t]·spread[t], loc[t] + c_i2[t]·spread[t], ...}`.
The rank/copula construction ensures the *marginals are still correct* — the
sorted ensemble at each cell still matches the input coefficient set — but the
*joint structure* becomes **spatially decorrelated**: member i's high value in
cell A does not imply a high value in cell B. At a downstream node, member i's
contribution from A may partially cancel its contribution from B.

**Why this matters for downstream uncertainty:**

Imagine two upstream cells feeding a single downstream node:

- **Comonotone** (full positive correlation across space): all members either flow
  wet from both cells or dry from both. Downstream spread is the worst-case sum.
- **Spatially correlated** (member i wet in A, dry in B; member j dry in A, wet
  in B): flows partially cancel at the downstream node. Spread is narrower.

**In practical terms**, the comonotone band is conservative (wider) because it
assumes the worst-case: "every source is either uniformly overestimated or
underestimated across the whole domain." The spatially-correlated band is more
physically realistic (narrower) because it accounts for the spatial
heterogeneity of real storms — a rain cell that misses one region often hits
another.

**The `/spread` map in context:**

When you supply a grid file with `/location` (deterministic rain) and `/spread`
(uncertainty), you are specifying:
- **`/location` per-cell**: the mean rainfall at that cell.
- **`/spread` per-cell**: the *marginal* standard deviation or half-range at
  that cell (e.g., from a BME posterior, rain-gauge measurement error, or
  radar-QPE climatology).
- **Comonotone structure** (default): the ROM assumes all ensemble members are
  perfectly correlated — the same realization everywhere.
- **Spatial correlation** (via `COHERENCE CORR_LEN`): the ROM builds a
  spatially-smooth set of rankings, so members' realizations decorrelate by
  distance.

### Why the reduced-basis trick keeps the ROM fast

When you activate spatial correlation, the engine must generate a correlated rainfall field
on each time step — originally an `M×n` materialization for all `M` members at `n` space-time
points. For large meshes (tens of thousands of cells), this can dominate per-step cost or even
wall-clock time. The *reduced-basis* optimization (automatically selected for large meshes)
replaces the `M×n` field with a compact spatial decomposition: a small set of `K_s` basis modes
(typically 10–50) whose weighted combinations reconstruct each member's field. Instead of
materializing all `M` fields, the engine computes only `K_s` basis projections per step
(O(K_s·k·n) arithmetic instead of O(M·k·n)), then assembles each member's forcing from the
basis coefficients (O(M·K_s·k)). Since `K_s ≪ M`, total per-step cost drops significantly.

The basis itself is built once at initialization using an analytic Whittle–Matérn spectral
decomposition (reproduced in
[`SPDE_SPATIAL_BASIS.md`](https://github.com/USEPA/Stormwater-Management-Model/blob/develop/docs/uncertainty/SPDE_SPATIAL_BASIS.md))
with the same correlation length `CORR_LEN <meters>` as the full correlated field — so
the ROM's behavior is unchanged, only the internal representation is more efficient. This
eliminated a 64-second field-generation bottleneck on typical large-mesh runs, making spatial
correlation practical even on production grids.
