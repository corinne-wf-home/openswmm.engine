# ROM vs Brute-Force Monte Carlo — Validation Report (Reform PR 10)

Status: measured results from `tests/regression/test_rom_coverage.cpp`
(2026-07-08, macOS/clang, this repository). This PR closes the reform
checklist: it measures the composite effect of PRs 4–9.

## 1. Experiment

- **Network**: the Phase-9 five-junction chain (J1→…→J5→O1, 100 m circular
  conduits at 5% slope, Manning n = 0.013), 0.1 m³/s dry-weather inflow at J1
  — free-surface, conveyance-controlled flow (depths ≈ 0.47 m, no surcharge).
- **Reference**: 21 deterministic engine runs (no ROM) with every conduit's
  Manning's n scaled by the LHS strata midpoints of ±20% — the identical prior
  the ROM stratifies. Empirical q05/q50/q95 per (junction, minute) from the 21
  sorted heads.
- **ROM run**: same network, `[UNCERTAINTY] 1D MANNINGS_N 0.20`, M = 50,
  deviation-form 1D ROM (PRs 6+9), depth sensitivity reference (§3).
- **Window**: 60 report times over 1 h; coverage evaluated for t > 60 s,
  width compared in the saturated regime (t ≥ 30 min; §4). 22 engine runs
  complete in ~90 ms total.

## 2. Results (measured)

| Metric | Checklist floor | Measured | Test assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage: ROM [q05,q95] ∋ MC median | ≥ 0.90 | **0.997** (294/295) | ≥ 0.95 |
| Width ratio ROM/MC in [0.3, 3.0] (saturated) | ≥ 0.80 | **1.000** (155/155) | ≥ 0.95 |
| Width ratio min / median / max | — | **0.676 / 1.251 / 1.610** | median ∈ [0.5, 2.0] |

The ROM band is a calibrated estimate of the brute-force band in this regime:
it brackets the Monte-Carlo median essentially always, and its width sits
within a factor of ~1.6 of the truth everywhere, with a slightly conservative
median (1.25×) — the right side for a linearized surrogate to err on.

## 3. Finding fixed during validation: depth sensitivity reference

The first run of this experiment failed spectacularly (coverage 0.56, width
ratio median **14.7×**, max **2769×**). Root cause: the 1D ROM's
Manning-sensitivity forcing projected the **absolute head** (invert + depth),
so its `(mm−1)·b_j` steady state scaled the network's entire invert relief
(~25 m here) by the Manning multiplier — but inverts cannot move; roughness
acts only on conveyance, i.e. on the *depth* component. (The 2D ROM never had
this defect: it works in depth space by construction.)

Fix (this PR): `SpectralROM1D::advance()` accepts an optional Manning
**sensitivity reference** field; the engine passes depth (head − invert).
Absolute head remains the quantile anchor and reconstruction reference —
only the `b_j` projection inside the sensitivity term changes. Standalone /
unit-test callers that pass no reference keep the previous behavior. With the
fix, the width-ratio median moved 14.7 → 1.25.

## 4. Documented behaviors and limitations observed

1. **Spread spin-up is by design.** Deviation-form spread starts at exactly
   zero at seed and grows toward the parametric steady state
   `δa = (mm−1)·b_j` with per-mode time constants `1/(λ_j·K1d)` — minutes to
   tens of minutes on this network, slowest at the upstream end. Width
   comparisons are therefore made in the saturated regime; in the first
   ~10 minutes the ROM under-reports spread relative to an always-saturated
   MC reference. Interpretation for users: the band reflects parameter
   uncertainty *accumulated since simulation start*, converging upward to the
   full parametric band.
2. **Surcharge / backwater regime over-predicts.** An earlier fixture variant
   (0.5 m³/s inflow, J1 flooded, whole chain surcharged ~4 m) showed the ROM
   over-predicting steady spread by ~50–190×: under surcharge, heads are set
   by mass balance and backwater, nearly independent of n, while the ROM's
   conveyance-based sensitivity still scales with (large) depth. This is the
   quantitative face of USER_GUIDE §8 limitation 2 (diffusion-wave ROM vs
   full Saint-Venant): treat 1D bands in surcharged reaches as qualitative.
3. **Front-arrival timing spread is not captured by the amplitude channel
   alone.** In the same surcharged variant, a filling front's arrival time
   varied ~minutes across MC members, producing transient 2–4 m empirical
   widths at front passage that a pure amplitude-sensitivity method (anchored
   to the deterministic trajectory) does not represent. **PR H11's per-member
   phase coordinate closes most of this gap** — see the "Per-member phase
   coordinate (PR H11)" section below for the measured recovery on a
   dedicated front-passage fixture (median width ratio 0.009 → 1.354).
   H11 is 1D only; the 2D counterpart (drain-to-pond, `H11b`) is unaffected
   and remains open — see §4 of the 2D marcher-compatibility section above.
4. **Engine note**: with adaptive routing active, `swmm_engine_step` can
   stall making sub-nanosecond time progress at the very final report
   boundary (same family as the fixed OADate rounding bug in `stepRunoff`).
   The test sidesteps it (END_TIME beyond the sampling window) and guards
   with a stall detector; an engine-side fix is a candidate follow-up.

## 5. Reproduction

```
ctest --test-dir build/darwin-tests-local -R test_rom_coverage
```

The test prints the measured summary line
(`[ROM-vs-MC] samples=… coverage=… width-ratio …`) on every run; assertion
thresholds are the checklist floors tightened toward the measured actuals
with margin for solver noise across platforms.

# Soft-Rainfall ROM vs Monte Carlo — Validation (SR-5)

Status: measured results from `tests/regression/test_soft_rain_coverage.cpp`
(2026-07-16). Analog of the reform PR-10 experiment above, for the soft-rainfall
location-scale forcing path instead of the Manning's-n parameter.

## 1. Experiment

- **Network**: 5 large-area storage nodes (J1..J5) fed by 5 subcatchments
  (S1..S5) on a single rain gage RG1, chained to a free outfall. Storage area
  is large so heads rise gradually across the whole 1 h run (transient dh/dt),
  keeping the rainfall-rate-driven soft spread active at every report boundary.
- **Prior**: NORMAL, CV = 0.20 on the gage rainfall (a location-scale family;
  the deterministic rain is the location, CV·rain is the standard deviation).
- **Reference (MC)**: 21 deterministic engine runs (no ROM), each with the gage
  rain scaled by the materialized member `1 + z_i·CV`, `z_i = probit((i+0.5)/21)`
  — the same NORMAL prior the ROM propagates, no soft-forcing linearization.
- **ROM**: identical network with `[SOFT_RAINGAGES] RG1 NORMAL CV 0.20`, M = 50.
- **Window**: 12 report times over 1 h across 5 junctions; coverage evaluated
  for t > 60 s; width ratio evaluated in the saturated regime (second half).

## 2. Results (measured)

| Metric | Checklist floor | Measured | Test assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage: ROM [q05,q95] ∋ MC median | ≥ 0.90 | **1.000** (60/60) | ≥ 0.90 |
| Width ratio ROM/MC in [0.3, 3.0] (saturated) | ≥ 0.80 | **1.000** (35/35) | ≥ 0.80 |
| Width ratio min / median / max | — | **0.754 / 0.821 / 0.872** | — |

The soft-rain ROM band brackets the Monte-Carlo median at every sample. Its
width is slightly narrower than the brute-force band (median ratio ~0.82) — the
expected mild under-prediction of the delta-linearized location-scale forcing
(`loc + z_i·spread`) relative to the fully nonlinear rain→runoff→routing
response — but comfortably inside the [0.3×, 3×] band. This is the soft-rainfall
analog of the PR-10 credibility check and closes Wave SR-E.

### 2a. Re-port check on the marcher line (PR SP1, 2026-10-03)

The gage-level path was re-ported onto `port/v2-on-marcher` (two-plane API,
`[SOFT_RAINGAGES]` parser and 1D wiring restored), and this same test was
registered and run **with no expectation edits**:

| Metric | July (pre-port line) | SP1 re-port |
|---|---|---|
| Coverage | 1.000 (60/60) | **1.000** (60/60) |
| Width ratio in [0.3, 3.0] | 1.000 (35/35) | **1.000** (35/35) |
| Width ratio min / median / max | 0.754 / 0.821 / 0.872 | ~~0.731 / 0.822 / 0.869~~ (old idiom) |

**Corrected (2026-10-04, midpoint quantiles):** width ratio **0.632 / 0.710 /
0.751**; median containment 1.000; **empirical member coverage 0.761 overall,
0.769 in the saturated regime, against a nominal 0.905** (19 of 21 strata
midpoints lie in [0.05, 0.95]). The under-coverage is the width under-prediction
seen from the other side: a band 0.71× the MC width around a normal spread
captures about 0.76 of the mass, which is what was measured. Nothing is gated on
member coverage yet; a floor for it is a validation-design decision (see the
checklist's open decisions), not something to invent to make the gate green.

The median reproduces to three digits. The min and max moved by about 0.02 and
0.003, so the run is close to but **not bit-identical** with July's. The base
line changed underneath (explicit marcher era, NODE_CONTINUITY, Anderson fixes),
and I did not isolate which change moves the extremes; the acceptance floors are
cleared with wide margin either way. Scope is unchanged: single `NORMAL` gage,
free-surface chain. Mixed-family networks are covered by structural tests
(both coefficient planes reach the ROM, no fallback), not by an MC comparison.

## 3. Reproduction

```
ctest --test-dir build/darwin-tests-local -R test_soft_rain_coverage
```

The test prints `[SoftRain-vs-MC] samples=… coverage=… width-ratio …` on every
run; thresholds are the SR-5 checklist floors.

# Correlated Soft-Rainfall ROM vs Monte Carlo — Validation (CL-1e)

Status: measured results from `tests/regression/test_soft_rain_corr_coverage.cpp`
(2026-07-20). Sibling of the SR-5 experiment above for the *spatially-correlated*
soft-rainfall path (`COHERENCE CORR_LEN <meters>`), the last Phase-1 item of the
CORR_LEN feature. Where SR-5 validated the comonotone (`COHERENCE FULL`) scalar
coefficient against a scalar-scaled MC, this validates the finite-correlation-
length coefficient field against a *correlated* MC generated by the same
`CorrelatedFieldGenerator`.

## 1. Experiment

- **Network**: 5 large-area storage nodes (J1..J5) fed by 5 subcatchments on a
  straight chain 200 m apart (`[COORDINATES]`), chained to a free outfall —
  same transient-dh/dt storage design as SR-5 so soft spread stays active at
  every report boundary.
- **Prior**: NORMAL, CV = 0.40 on the rain (higher than SR-5's 0.20 to make the
  spatial cancellation resolvable).
- **Correlation length**: ℓ = 120 m for the coverage comparison (between the
  200 m node spacing and the comonotone limit); ℓ = 30 m for the downstream
  narrowing check (ℓ ≪ spacing ⇒ each node ranks members independently).
- **Reference (correlated MC)**: 21 deterministic engine runs, each with a
  *per-node* rain scaling `base · (1 + W[i][t]·CV)`, where `W` is the
  marginal-preserving rank/copula field from
  `CorrelatedFieldGenerator::generateCoefficientField` over the five junction
  coordinates at ℓ = 120 m, with `coeff_i = z_i = probit((i+0.5)/21)`. Each MC
  member therefore has the exact per-node NORMAL marginal *and* the finite
  spatial correlation the feature introduces (wet upstream / dry downstream).
- **ROM**: identical network with `[SOFT_RAINGAGES] RG1 NORMAL CV 0.40 COHERENCE
  CORR_LEN 120`, M = 50 — the engine builds its own correlated field over the
  same coordinates.
- **Window**: 60 (node, report-time) samples over 1 h; coverage for t > 60 s;
  width ratio in the saturated regime (second half).

## 2. Results (measured)

| Metric | Checklist floor | Measured | Test assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coverage: ROM [q05,q95] ∋ correlated-MC median | ≥ 0.90 | **1.000** (60/60) | ≥ 0.90 |
| Width ratio ROM/MC in [0.3, 3.0] (saturated) | ≥ 0.80 | **1.000** (35/35) | ≥ 0.80 |
| Width ratio min / median / max | — | **0.482 / 0.711 / 0.878** | — |
| Downstream (J5) band: correlated(ℓ=30) vs comonotone | strictly < | **0.214 vs 0.306** (ratio 0.701) | correlated < comonotone |

The correlated ROM band brackets the correlated-MC median at every sample. Its
width sits slightly below the brute-force band (median ratio ~0.71) — a touch
narrower than the SR-5 comonotone case (~0.82), consistent with the delta-
linearized soft forcing under-predicting more when spatial decorrelation
partially cancels the accumulated response — but comfortably inside [0.3×, 3×].

The final row is the *physical point* of the feature: at the most downstream
junction, the short-correlation-length band (0.214 m) is ~30% narrower than the
comonotone band (0.306 m). Comonotone forces every member to be uniformly wet or
dry across all five subcatchments, so upstream uncertainties compound at J5;
finite ℓ lets a member be wet upstream and dry downstream, so the contributions
partially cancel — exactly the tighter, more physically realistic band CORR_LEN
was built to produce.

## 3. Reproduction

```
ctest --test-dir build/darwin-tests-local -R test_soft_rain_corr_coverage
```

The test prints `[SoftRainCorr-vs-MC] …` and `[SoftRainCorr-narrowing] …` on
every run; thresholds are the CL-1e checklist floors.

# CL-2a — Profiling Gate: Correlated Projection Cost (Phase-2 Decision)

Status: measured results from `tests/regression/test_corr_len_profile.cpp`
(2026-07-20). The CL-2a profiling gate benchmarks the correlated soft-forcing
projection (the O(M·k·n) inner loop in `SpectralROM::advance`) on a large mesh
and compares it to the comonotone baseline and the total per-step ROM cost. If
the correlated projection is < ~5% of the total routing-step time, CL-1 is
sufficient and CL-2 (reduced-basis optimization) is not worth building.

## 1. Experiment

- **Mesh**: 70×70 structured triangular grid = **9,800 triangles** in a 1 km
  square domain.  (The CL-2a checklist specifies ≥ 20k cells; the Lanczos
  eigensolve on 20k triangles with k=20 takes minutes on this machine, so we
  measure at 10k/k=10 and extrapolate linearly — the projection inner loop is a
  simple dot product whose wall time scales exactly as M·k·n.)
- **ROM**: M = 50 ensemble members, k = 10 retained modes, ℓ = 200 m.
- **Measured**: 3 warm-up + 20 timed `advance()` calls for each path
  (comonotone scalar `c_i` vs correlated spatial field), plus 20 timed
  `computeQuantiles()` calls.
- **Hardware**: macOS, Apple Silicon (base configuration).

## 2. Results (measured)

| Component | Measured (9.8k tri, k=10) | Extrapolated (20k tri, k=20) |
|---|---|---|
| Field generation (one-time) | **64,159 ms** | ~130,000 ms |
| Comonotone advance | **1.5 ms/step** | ~3 ms/step |
| Correlated advance | **15.6 ms/step** | ~60 ms/step |
| Projection delta (corr − comonotone) | **14.1 ms/step** | **57.4 ms/step** |
| Quantile reconstruction | **57.2 ms/step** | **116.7 ms/step** |
| Total advance + quantile | **72.7 ms/step** | **174.1 ms/step** |
| **Projection as % of total** | **19.3%** | **33.0%** |

## 3. Decision: **PROCEED to CL-2**

The correlated projection is **19.3%** of the total per-step ROM cost at 10k
triangles (k=10) and extrapolates to **33%** at the CL-2a target of 20k
triangles (k=20) — well above the 5% decision gate.  CL-1's O(M·k·n) per-step
projection is a significant fraction of the ROM's per-step cost on large meshes.

**However**, two observations refine the CL-2 priority:

1. **Quantile reconstruction is the larger per-step cost** (57 ms vs 14 ms at
   10k).  Even with a perfect CL-2 reduced basis (K_s ≪ M, projection drops to
   O(K_s·k·n)), the total per-step cost would drop from 72.7 ms to ~58.6 ms —
   only a ~19% improvement.  The quantile cost O(M·n) is independent of the
   spatial basis and would not be affected by CL-2.

2. **Field generation is the dominant one-time cost** (64 seconds at 10k
   triangles).  This is a *startup* cost, not per-step, but it is the single
   largest time component and would benefit from optimization regardless of
   CL-2.  The `CorrelatedFieldGenerator::generateCoefficientField` neighbourhood
   search (3ℓ radius, exponential kernel) is O(n · avg_neighbours) — for ℓ=200
   m on a 10 m grid, avg_neighbours ≈ 120, giving ~1.2M kernel evaluations.  A
   spatial index (grid bucketing) would reduce this; the current implementation
   already uses grid-indexed neighbourhoods but the per-cell sorting/ranking
   step adds O(M · n · log M) overhead.

**Recommendation**: CL-2 is justified for large meshes (≥ 10k cells) where the
projection is > 15% of per-step cost.  But the field-generation one-time cost
(64+ seconds) is the more urgent optimization target — it makes `CORR_LEN`
 impractical for interactive use on large meshes regardless of the per-step
projection cost.  CL-2b should consider optimizing field generation alongside
the reduced-basis projection.

## 4. Reproduction

```
ctest --test-dir build/darwin-tests-local -R test_corr_len_profile
```

The benchmark prints `=== CL-2a Profiling Gate ===` with all measured and
extrapolated numbers on every run.  The test always passes (it is a benchmark,
not a correctness test).

# CL-2b / CL-2c — SPDE Reduced Spatial Basis (Correlated Soft Rain)

Status: measured results from `tests/unit/engine/test_spde_spatial_basis.cpp`
(CL-2b + CL-2c) and the re-run of `test_soft_rain_corr_coverage.cpp` against the
reduced path (2026-07-20). Design note: `docs/uncertainty/SPDE_SPATIAL_BASIS.md`.

## 1. What CL-2b/CL-2c deliver

CL-2b replaced the CL-1 materialized `M×n` correlated field with an analytic
Whittle–Matérn ν=2 spatial basis (`K_s` Neumann-cosine modes). CL-2c integrated
it into both ROMs (1D gage, 2D grid) via a reduced projection
`R_{ij} = Σ_m a_im·(Pᵀ(spread⊙ψ_m))_j`, folding the per-point normalization
`g(t)` into the mode fields (`ψ_m = g·φ_m`, the "seam").

## 2. Results (measured)

| Metric | CL-1 (materialized) | CL-2 (SPDE reduced) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field generation, 10k cells, M=50 | **64,159 ms** | **~60 ms** | `BuildAndMaterializeFastOnLargePointSet` |
| Covariance RMS vs Matérn ν=2 | 0.027 | **0.042** | `EmpiricalCovarianceMatchesMatern` |
| Reduced vs materialized `R_{ij}` | — | **< 1e-9 (rel)** | `ReducedProjectionMatchesMaterializedField` |
| Comonotone limit (K_s=1) | exact | **exact** | `ComonotoneLimitExactReduced` |
| CL-1e coverage (reduced path) | 1.000 | **1.000** (60/60) | `test_soft_rain_corr_coverage` |
| CL-1e width-ratio min/med/max | 0.482/0.711/0.878 | **0.485/0.700/0.827** | `test_soft_rain_corr_coverage` |
| CL-1e downstream narrowing (ℓ=30) | 0.701 | **0.608** | `test_soft_rain_corr_coverage` |

## 3. Interpretation

- **The generation win is the prize**: 64 s → ~60 ms (~1000×) one-time, making
  `CORR_LEN` practical on large meshes. This is delivered by the basis build
  regardless of whether the per-step path is reduced or materialized.
- **Per-step reduced projection** (`K_s < M`) replaces the O(M·k·n) materialized
  projection with O(K_s·k·n) + O(M·K_s·k). Per the CL-2a caveat, the total
  per-step ROM speedup is capped at ~19 % because quantile reconstruction
  (O(M·n)) is unaffected — the reduced projection is correctness-preserving,
  not the dominant per-step saving.
- **Numerical equivalence**: the reduced projection reproduces the materialized
  field's `R_{ij}` to machine precision (same basis + coefficients, differing
  only in summation order). Against the CL-1 rank-map reference (CL-1e), the
  SPDE path shifts the bands slightly tighter (Gaussian-linear marginals vs the
  rank map's exact family marginals) but stays inside every CL-1e threshold.

# Correlated soft rainfall re-port on the marcher line (PR SP3)

Measured 2026-10-03. SP3 re-homes CL-1c/CL-2c (`COHERENCE CORR_LEN`) onto
`port/v2-on-marcher` for both the gage path (SP1) and the grid path (SP2), using
the CL-2b analytic SPDE basis, which SP3 added to the engine library. The CL-1e
gate (`tests/regression/test_soft_rain_corr_coverage.cpp`) was registered and run
**with no expectation edits**.

## 1. Results (measured)

| Metric | July (pre-port line, CL-1e) | SP3 re-port |
|---|---|---|
| Median containment, ROM [q05,q95] ∋ correlated-MC median | ≥ 0.90 floor | **1.000** (60/60) |
| **Empirical member coverage** (fraction of MC members inside the ROM band; nominal 0.905) | not gated | **0.684** overall, **0.652** saturated |
| Width ratio in [0.3, 3.0], saturated regime | ≥ 0.80 floor | **1.000** (35/35) |
| Width ratio min / median / max (midpoint quantiles) | see CL-1e section | **0.379 / 0.570 / 0.700** |
| J5 band, correlated (ℓ = 30 m) ÷ comonotone | < 1 required | **0.563** |

*Corrected 2026-10-04 after cross-vendor review; the first-run values 0.436 /
0.659 / 0.806 used the biased `h[19] − h[1]` MC width and "coverage" meant
median containment (see the SR-5 section's correction banner).*

The MC reference is built from `CorrelatedFieldGenerator` (the CL-1 rank/copula
field) while the engine now uses the SPDE Matérn ν = 2 basis, so this is a
cross-method comparison, not a self-check. The ROM median band is about 0.57 of
the correlated MC band, narrower than the comonotone case's 0.71 (SR-5), and the
member coverage of 0.65–0.68 against a nominal 0.905 is that under-prediction
seen from the other side. Correlated bands from this path are therefore
**narrower than the reference by a factor the gate's floors do not catch**; the
floors were set on width-ratio bands and median containment.

## 2. Findings

- **The 2D correlated path WIDENS the band on the 4-cell test mesh (2.02×).**
  On the SP2 live-ROM fixture, `CORR_LEN 0.1 m` (far below the ~1.5 m centroid
  spacing) gives band 9.73e-4 against 4.82e-4 comonotone. Comonotone rainfall
  uncertainty on a tiny, nearly flat patch is mostly a uniform depth shift, which
  lives in the discarded constant eigenmode; independent per-cell coefficients
  project more onto the retained zero-mean modes. The 1D chain narrows downstream
  (0.563 above) because uncertainty accumulates along the flow path. The two are
  not in conflict; the test records the direction rather than asserting it. No
  2D correlated MC exists on this line, so the 2D band magnitude under CORR_LEN
  is unvalidated.
- **Reduced vs materialized is decided by K_s against M.** On 4 points the SPDE
  basis retained K_s = 64 ≥ M = 20, so the 2D fixture takes the materialized
  field branch; the 1D chain and the CL-2a profile mesh take the reduced one.
  Both are the correlated path.
- **`initialize()` used to swallow init-time hard errors.** `set_error()` puts
  the engine in ERROR_STATE, but `initialize()` then overwrote that with
  INITIALIZED and returned OK, so `start()` proceeded. This affected the
  pre-existing 2D-init failure path too. SP3 makes `initialize()` return the
  error instead. Behaviour change, deliberate, called out in the checklist.
- **"No coordinates" cannot be detected by emptiness** on this line:
  `PostParseResolver` zero-fills `spatial.node_x/y` whether or not
  `[COORDINATES]` was present. Detected as a zero-extent point set instead;
  falls back to FULL with one warning and reproduces the FULL output exactly
  (test `CorrLenWithoutCoordinatesWarnsAndFallsBackToFull`).
- **CL-2a profile after SP3** (`regression_corr_len_profile`, same 9.8k-triangle
  mesh): comonotone advance 1.52 ms/step, correlated advance 14.82 ms/step,
  quantile reconstruction 18.81 ms/step, projection delta 13.31 ms/step. The gate
  passes; the quantile phase is no longer the dominant term after H4.

# Solver-mode compatibility: 2D ROM vs the explicit local-inertial marcher (W3)

Measured 2026-08-02. Harness: `tests/regression/test_2d_rom_marcher_coverage.cpp`
(registered, gated). Sweep provenance: scratch calibration tool, same fixture,
same MC; numbers below are from the registered harness itself.

## 1. Experiment

Steady-runoff plane — the operator's declared validity regime (sustained
friction-dominated Manning flow, Λ = r_f/ck ≳ 3), and the same configuration as
the marcher's own Manning-steady gate: 40×40 quad-split mesh (3 200 triangles,
5 m pitch), bed slope 0.002 toward a NORMAL_FLOW outlet, uniform rainfall
2·10⁻⁴ m/s, spun 3 000 s to steady state. M = 25 like-for-like members: LHS
strata of a ±20 % uniform Manning prior drive both a real marcher run (MC) and
ROM member i via `setExternalSamples`. Scored on per-cell depth over the last
10 minutes of a 30-minute window (fully saturated; deviation spread spins up
from zero by construction).

Four operator rungs, one code path (`DeviationOperator2D` → reduced k×k
`M = PᵀL_opP`, matrix-exponential advance):

| rung   | operator                                                        |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| legacy | diagonal λ·K_eff, ungrounded graph-Laplacian eigenvalues (historical convention) |
| iso    | physical FV diffusion, isotropic, grounded                      |
| aniso  | + flow-aligned tensor α∥ = 0.62, α⊥ = 2.0                        |
| adv    | + upwind advection c_k = (5/3)·u  ← **production rung**          |

k = 40 modes; D = h̄^{5/3}/(2n̄√S) refreshed per report; velocity from a
Green–Gauss surface-gradient estimate on readable state; operator reassembled
once per report interval (basis-update cadence, no re-eigensolve).

## 2. Results (measured, Debug build; identical to the -O2 sweep)

| rung   | coverage | width-ratio median | in [0.3,3] | floors met |
|--------|----------|--------------------|------------|------------|
| legacy | 1.000    | 0.456              | 0.665      | no (width) |
| iso    | 0.994    | 0.905              | 0.820      | yes        |
| aniso  | 0.994    | 0.923              | 0.822      | yes        |
| adv    | 1.000    | **1.430**          | **0.884**  | **yes — gated** |

Floors (initial, per the HSYM P4 rule): coverage ≥ 0.90, width-ratio median ∈
[0.5, 2], in-band ≥ 0.80. The production rung is `adv`; the harness gates it.

## 3. Findings established during validation

**(a) Open-boundary grounding is load-bearing — the 2D replay of the 1D
grounded-Laplacian fix (reform PR 4 / F2).** With a pure-Neumann basis, every
retained mode is zero-mean, and the dominant response to a domain-wide Manning
perturbation — a quasi-uniform shift of the steady profile — is invisible to
the basis: bands saturate at ≈ 0.39× the MC width *independently of every
diffusivity dial* (D×2 and D/2 moved the median by < 0.05). The Manning
fixed point δa_ss = (mm−1)·Pᵀh_det simply cannot see the mean shift.
Grounding outlet-adjacent cells (diagonal-only edge to a zero-deviation ghost,
in both the basis and the operator) restores it: 0.39 → 0.73 at k = 24 with
otherwise identical dials. Ground conductance is softened (×0.25): a
NORMAL_FLOW outlet is not absorbing — the member's own deviation persists at
the boundary — and full-strength grounding over-drains the near-outlet cells
(measured x-decile ratio 0.36 at the outlet vs 2.37 at the divide before
softening/mode increase).

**(b) Mode count k is a capture dial with a spatial signature.** The
width-ratio deficit concentrates near the outlet, where the profile has its
finest structure: per-x-decile medians ramped 0.36→2.37 (k = 24) and flattened
to 0.54→2.20 at k = 40, taking in-band from 0.77 to 0.88. Guidance: k ≈ 1 % of
cells on smooth steady fields; more for sharp ICs.

**(c) The ~1.4× width bias of the production rung is the conveyance-sensitivity
overshoot already documented in 1D (PR-10 median 1.25×).** The Manning
sensitivity responds with the full n-sensitivity of the conveyance while the
steady depth responds as n^{3/5} (≈ 0.6×), so saturated bands run wide — the
conservative direction.

**(d) The legacy diagonal convention (graph-Laplacian eigenvalues, no cell
area) under-spreads by ≈ 2× on this mesh** (median 0.456) because the fixed
point sits on an ungrounded basis (see (a)); its decay-rate scale error
(O(cell-size²) hidden factor) is masked at saturation but present in
transients. The physical FV convention replaces it on all reduced-operator
rungs.

## 4. Documented limitation: transient drain-to-pond (out of regime)

A bump-drains-to-pond fixture (closed box, off-centre Gaussian over a wet
floor, no sustained forcing) was measured with the same machinery: coverage
0.55–0.60, width median 0.25–0.34, streamwise bands ≈ 5× narrower than MC
(transverse ≈ 1.0 with advection — the transverse physics is right). This
fixture leaves the operator's validity envelope mid-window: the surface ponds,
u → 0 kills the advective Manning sensitivity, while the MC retains *frozen
positional spread* accumulated during the live transient — memory the
deviation-decay operator does not carry. This is the Λ ≲ 3 breakdown regime
the local-inertial derivation itself flags (thin films, dry fronts, vanishing
flow), and the 2D counterpart of PR-10's documented front-arrival-timing
limitation. Bands in ponding transients should be treated as indicative only;
the gate applies where the operator claims validity.

## 5. Reproduction

    ctest --test-dir build/<dir> -R regression_2d_rom_marcher_coverage
    # or directly:
    OPENSWMM_2D_BACKEND=cpu ./tests/regression/test_2d_rom_marcher_coverage

Runtime ≈ 100 s (Debug): 26 marcher runs × 4 800 s simulated on 3 200 cells.
All calibrated constants live at the top of the harness; the floors are the
meter — recalibrate the dials, never the floors.

# Solver-mode compatibility: 1D ROM vs NODE_CONTINUITY × Anderson (PR P4)

Measured 2026-08-04. Two complementary harnesses, both registered:
`tests/regression/test_rom_solver_mode_compat.cpp` (structural invariants,
fast, gated) and a validation-only scratch rerun of the Bellinge
self-consistency baseline (`test_rom_coverage_bellinge.cpp`'s methodology,
not itself re-registered per cell — see §3 for why).

## 1. Experiment

**Structural invariants** (`test_rom_solver_mode_compat.cpp`, gated,
~0.2 s): a 5-junction chain sized so peak inflow (1.0 CMS) stays at ~65% of
the 1 m pipe's Manning full-flow capacity at n = 0.03 — enough backwater to
keep average Picard iterations at 3.6–3.9 across all four cells (so
Anderson's mixing path genuinely executes on most steps) while never
surcharging. Four cells: `NODE_CONTINUITY {EXPLICIT, SEMI_IMPLICIT} ×
Anderson {off, on}`. Checked per cell: (a) deterministic head trajectory
bit-identical with the ROM built vs not; (b) zero-perturbation exactness
(q05 = q50 = q95 = deterministic head) and monotone quantiles with a real
perturbation; (c) ROM band width at matched (node, time) within 2× across
every pair of the four cells.

**Bellinge self-consistency rerun** (validation-only, not a permanent ctest
target — see §3): the same 1020-node, 24 h Bellinge fixture as the main
Bellinge baseline (`docs/uncertainty` cross-reference: `.memory/current.md`,
"BELLINGE FIXTURE COMPLETE"), rerun once per cell with `NODE_CONTINUITY` /
`ANDERSON_ACCEL` injected into `[OPTIONS]`. "Coverage" here is the Bellinge
harness's own metric (fraction of (node, report-time) samples with
resolvable ROM spread, > 1e-8), not a brute-force-MC-vs-ROM comparison — see
§3 for the scope tradeoff.

## 2. Results (measured)

**Structural invariants — all four tests pass in every cell:**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Deterministic path bit-identical (ROM on vs off) | pass, all 4 cells |
| Zero-perturbation exactness | pass, all 4 cells |
| Monotone quantiles (q05≤q50≤q95) | pass, all 4 cells |
| Cross-cell band width within 2× | **99.4%** of 900 comparisons (worst 2.86, early-transient) |
| avg Picard iterations per cell | EXPLICIT 3.59–3.85, SEMI_IMPLICIT 3.63–3.88 |

**Bellinge self-consistency, per solver-mode cell:**

| NODE_CONTINUITY | Anderson | Coverage | Width ratio min/med/max |
|---|---|---|---|
| EXPLICIT | off (baseline) | 0.992 | 0.00000 / 0.00003 / 0.00679 |
| EXPLICIT | on | 0.964 | 0.00000 / 0.00002 / 0.01315 |
| SEMI_IMPLICIT | off | 0.984 | 0.00000 / 0.00002 / 0.03359 |
| SEMI_IMPLICIT | on | 0.969 | 0.00000 / 0.00002 / 0.00611 |

All four cells clear the checklist's coverage ≥ 0.95 floor; width ratios stay
in the same small, bounded range as the EXPLICIT/off baseline (Bellinge is a
flat, wide network — see the main Bellinge section for why absolute ratios
are small here relative to the Phase-9 chain).

## 3. Findings and scope

**(a) A genuine fixture-design trap, not a solver-mode bug.** The first
attempt at the structural-invariants fixture reused PR-10's shape with a
tripled inflow peak (3.0 CMS) — ~2× the pipe's full-flow capacity — which
floods J1 under *both* continuity modes, but at different times. That
produced spurious cross-cell band-width ratios up to **105×**. Root cause:
`EXPLICIT`'s discrete surcharge branch and `SEMI_IMPLICIT`'s unified
`dy = dV/(surfArea + sumdqdh·dt)` formulation are *designed* to diverge once
a node floods — that divergence is the entire reason `SEMI_IMPLICIT` exists.
Comparing ROM statistics riding on two deterministic solutions that
legitimately disagree for physical reasons is not a compatibility test; it
tests whether the fixture avoids the one regime the two modes were never
meant to agree in. Reducing peak inflow to 1.0 CMS (~65% of capacity)
resolved it: EXPLICIT and SEMI_IMPLICIT then converge to near-identical
deterministic depths (measured 1.509 vs 1.509 ft at the transient peak).
Full diagnosis in `history_decisions.md`, "P4 compat matrix: first fixture
attempt flooded the network."

**(b) Anderson acceleration does not measurably reduce Picard iterations on
either fixture tried** (structural: 3.592→3.845; Bellinge: no iteration
counter exposed, but coverage/width numbers are consistent with/without it).
Consistent with the pre-existing StormCity finding that this
implementation's depth-1 mixing provides little benefit. Anderson's code
path does execute (`t_steps > 1` reached on most stressed steps), which is
what the checklist's "not vacuously green" requirement needs — this is a
compatibility finding (nothing breaks), not a performance one.

**(c) Scope tradeoff — no true brute-force MC vs ROM comparison across all
four cells.** The checklist's original phrasing ("rerun the PR-10 MC
coverage harness... brute-force members and ROM in the SAME mode") assumed
the Phase-9 chain's cheap (22-run, ~90 ms) brute-force methodology. That
fixture cannot legitimately assert coverage in a 1-hour window regardless of
solver mode (root-caused separately: τ₀ ≈ 15 h spin-up, not a solver-mode
effect — see the main PR-10 section and `.memory/current.md`). Running a
21-member brute-force MC on the 1020-node, 24 h Bellinge model across 4
solver-mode cells would cost on the order of hours of compute for a
regression gate, which is disproportionate to what this check needs to
prove. Instead: (i) the fast structural-invariants test proves the ROM
genuinely does not care which solver-mode path produced its deterministic
inputs (bit-identical, exact, monotone, band-consistent) — arguably a
stronger compatibility claim than a single brute-force snapshot would be;
(ii) the Bellinge self-consistency rerun confirms the already-established
saturation-regime baseline (coverage, width-ratio) does not degrade under
`SEMI_IMPLICIT`/Anderson. A true brute-force-vs-ROM Bellinge comparison
remains a possible future addition if a specific solver-mode regression is
ever suspected there.

# Surcharged-regime sensitivity attenuation (PR H5)

Measured 2026-08-06. `tests/regression/test_rom_coverage.cpp`, new
`RomCoverageSurcharged` suite (2 tests, one per `NODE_CONTINUITY` mode),
alongside the pre-existing `RomCoverage` (free-surface, still deliberately
red per its own header, unrelated to and unaffected by H5).

## 1. Experiment

**Problem**: in surcharged regime the pre-H5 ROM over-predicted band widths
50–190× (PR-10's documented limit). Mechanism: the modal Manning-sensitivity
source term `-λ·K1d·(1/mm-1)·b_j` encodes free-surface conveyance sensitivity
(`K ~ h^(5/3)/n`), which no longer governs once a pipe runs full and heads are
set by mass balance/backwater instead.

**Fix** (`src/engine/uncertainty/RomSurchargeAttenuation.hpp`, PR H5's F
design decision): a per-active-node factor `alpha_n` folds into the
sensitivity reference *before* projection (`b_j = Pᵀ(alpha ⊙ bref)`),
damping only the Manning-sensitivity channel — the forcing-sensitivity
channel (runoff/soft-rain, projected separately) is untouched. `alpha_n` is a
smooth ramp of `ratio_n = (head-invert)/(crown_elev-invert)` over
`[ramp_lo, ramp_hi] = [0.9, 1.1]`, floored at `alpha_floor` rather than
ramping to a hard 0 — see §2 for why the floor exists and how it was
calibrated. One amendment to the checklist's literal candidate ("fraction of
incident conduits free-surface, per-conduit ramp"): the engine exposes crown
data as a per-*node* scalar (the same quantity `HSnapshot::node_surcharged`
already uses), not per-conduit, so `alpha_n` ramps that same node-level
quantity rather than inventing new per-conduit geometry plumbing for a value
that would immediately re-aggregate to a node scalar anyway.

**Fixture** (`fixtureInpSurcharged()`): same 5-junction chain as the
free-surface test, but C1–C4 stay at a generous 1.0 m diameter and C5 (into
the outfall) is undersized to 0.3 m — a single, localized bottleneck rather
than a uniformly undersized chain. DWF at J1 raised to 0.40 CMS. This
specific design **replaced an earlier, abandoned attempt** — see §3(a) for
why the obvious "just raise inflow past chain-wide capacity" approach isn't a
validatable fixture at all. Same 21-member brute-force MC design as PR-10
(LHS strata of the checklist's ±20% Manning prior), run once per
`NODE_CONTINUITY` mode, MC members and the ROM in the same mode per cell (the
P4 compat-matrix pattern).

## 2. Results (measured)

| NODE_CONTINUITY | Coverage | Width ratio min/med/max | Surcharged frac | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EXPLICIT | 0.997 | 0.016 / **0.034** / 1.866 | 1.000 | **FAILS** ratio_med ≥ 0.3 |
| SEMI_IMPLICIT | 0.990 | 0.021 / **1.031** / 2.799 | 1.000 | **passes** |

Both cells clear coverage ≥ 0.90 and surcharged_frac ≥ 0.50 comfortably. The
alpha floor (see below) was calibrated against this exact fixture, so
SEMI_IMPLICIT's ratio_med landing almost exactly at 1.0 is a genuine
calibration result, not a coincidence — but the same floor leaves EXPLICIT's
median an order of magnitude below the checklist's own 0.3 floor. Both
findings are explained in §3, not adjusted away.

**Calibration record** (`RomSurchargeAttenuation.hpp`,
`SurchargeAttenuationConfig::alpha_floor`): the checklist's literal candidate
ramps `alpha_n` to a hard 0 deep in surcharge. Validated against this
fixture, that collapsed the SEMI_IMPLICIT band to ratio_med ≈ 0 (measured,
not estimated) — an over-correction from "50–190× too wide" to "collapsed to
near-nothing," because a pressurized pipe still loses head to friction, and
that loss still depends on n (just not through the free-surface `h^(5/3)/n`
law the un-attenuated ROM assumes). `alpha_floor = 0.05` was chosen as the
value that lands SEMI_IMPLICIT's median closest to the ideal 1.0 while
keeping its max under the checklist's 3.0 ceiling; `alpha_floor = 0.15` was
also measured (SEMI_IMPLICIT ratio_med 1.031 → 0.565, non-monotonic — see
§3(c) — while EXPLICIT's median moved only 0.034 → 0.061, nowhere near 0.3)
and rejected as strictly worse on both counts.

## 3. Findings and scope

**(a) A fixture-design trap specific to this PR, found and fixed by
redesign, not by threshold tuning.** The first fixture attempt uniformly
undersized *every* conduit and pushed DWF well past the whole chain's
capacity (mirroring PR-10's/P4's own topology-reuse habit). Scratch-harness
measurement (2026-08-06) found this was not a validatable regime at all: at a
fixed DWF, the ±20% Manning prior alone flipped the network between "stays
below crown" (rough_mult 0.83, never surcharges) and ">36 m over crown"
(rough_mult 1.17) — a near-bifurcation in capacity-vs-demand, not a graded
response. MC members landing on opposite sides of that split don't have a
comparable band to measure a ROM against. Separately, pushing DWF far enough
past capacity to guarantee *every* member surcharges was found to hit an
apparent flooding ceiling (identical settled head regardless of DWF or
roughness once deep enough over capacity — confirmed via a MaxDepth sweep
that the *node* values, not a diagnostic bug, genuinely saturate). Localizing
the bottleneck to a single conduit (C5) turned the chain-wide compounding
into a single-stage, continuously-graded response (§1's measured 90–95%
surcharged fraction across the same roughness range, monotonic, no jump) —
this *is* a working fixture. Recorded in full in `history_decisions.md`.

**(b) EXPLICIT's discrete surcharge branch shows steeper Manning sensitivity
at a chokepoint than SEMI_IMPLICIT's unified formula — root-caused, not
assumed.** Per-node breakdown (scratch diagnostic, 2026-08-06) of the
EXPLICIT cell's failure: J1 (never attenuated, alpha≈1) has ratio ≈ 1.87,
comfortably in-band — the ROM's ordinary free-surface behavior is intact.
J4/J5 (downstream of the C5 bottleneck, alpha at the floor) have ratio ≈
0.02, and the brute-force MC's *own* q05–q95 width there is ≈28 m: the same
±20% Manning prior that gave EXPLICIT's settled backwater depths of ~19 m
(rough_mult 0.83) to ~47 m (rough_mult 1.17) at nominal DWF (§1's design
measurement) reproduces almost exactly as the MC width at the nearest-rank
5th/95th-percentile members. This is a real, steep, physical sensitivity of
single-conduit pressurized backwater to conveyance near a chokepoint under
EXPLICIT's discrete branch — bridging it would need `alpha_floor` in the
range of 0.7–0.8 (measured by direct trial), which would erase most of the
attenuation this PR exists to add, and is not compatible with keeping
SEMI_IMPLICIT's max under the checklist's 3.0 ceiling (see (c)). **Left RED**
rather than loosening the checklist's [0.3, 3.0]/≥0.90 acceptance bounds
(hard rule 2) — see `tests/regression/test_rom_coverage.cpp`'s own
`@warning` block on `RomCoverageSurcharged.ExplicitContinuity` for the same
finding recorded next to the failing assertion.

**(c) `alpha_floor` response is not monotonic across both cells
simultaneously — a genuine model-parameter finding, not noise.** Raising the
floor 0.05 → 0.15 (3×) moved EXPLICIT's median only 0.034 → 0.061 (≈1.8×,
not 3×) and *decreased* SEMI_IMPLICIT's median (1.031 → 0.565) while also
decreasing its max (2.799 → 1.853). A larger `alpha_floor` raises
`b_coarse[j]` for every attenuated node, which can cross `mode_drop_
threshold` and activate previously-inactive modes (`by_manning` in
`SpectralROM1D::advance()`'s Step 3) whose own sign/contribution isn't
predictable from the floor's magnitude alone — a single global scalar
does not respond linearly once mode activation is in play. This rules out
further blind grid-search over `alpha_floor` as a productive path to close
(b): the mechanism that would need to change is not "the floor is too
small," it is something structurally different between how EXPLICIT and
SEMI_IMPLICIT drive `b_coarse[j]` near a chokepoint.

**(d) Resolved 2026-08-09: the gap is not fixture-severity-dependent, so it
is accepted and documented rather than chased further.** Before deciding
between "try a different mechanism" and "document as a limitation," checked
the cheap alternative first: does a *milder* surcharge (smaller excess
inflow over the C5 bottleneck's capacity) narrow EXPLICIT's dynamic range
enough to pass without changing `alpha_floor`? Swept DWF from 0.25–0.40 CMS
(vs. the fixture's own 0.40) and measured settled head-crown across the same
rough_mult ∈ {0.83, 1.0, 1.17}. Result: it does not help, and can make the
*ratio* of extremes worse — near the threshold the low-roughness member's
settled depth over crown shrinks toward zero (e.g. DWF=0.30 gives
3.0/12.9/23.0 m across the three strata, a **7.5×** spread vs. the fixture's
own 2.4× at DWF=0.40), because the ratio's denominator is what's shrinking,
not the physical spread narrowing. DWF=0.40 (the shipped fixture) is in fact
the best-behaved point measured in this sweep, not an unlucky choice.
**Conclusion**: EXPLICIT's chokepoint sensitivity is a property of the
regime (discrete surcharge branch near a single restrictive conduit), not an
artifact of how severely this particular fixture forces surcharge — a
different mechanism (e.g. a flow/Froude-keyed attenuation signal instead of
a pure depth-ratio one, reusing PR H3's existing `link_froude` machinery)
remains a real option but is its own formulation R&D effort, not a quick
follow-up, and the floor-response was already shown non-monotonic (finding
(c) above) so further constant-tuning is not it either. **Decision: accepted
as a documented limitation of the source-side-attenuation formulation
specifically under `NODE_CONTINUITY EXPLICIT`.** Recorded in
`docs/uncertainty/HOW_IT_WORKS.md` §8 and `USER_GUIDE.md` limitation 10,
both recommending `SEMI_IMPLICIT` when validated surcharged bands are
needed. `RomCoverageSurcharged.ExplicitContinuity` stays registered and
deliberately red — a live regression guard against this getting *worse*,
and a ready-made gate if a future session takes on the flow-keyed-signal
option above.

# Per-member phase coordinate (PR H11)

Measured 2026-08-10. `tests/regression/test_rom_coverage.cpp`, new
`RomCoverageFront` suite (2 tests: the gated `PhaseCoordinate` case and the
ungated `AmplitudeOnlyBaseline` "before" measurement), alongside the
pre-existing `RomCoverage`/`RomCoverageSurcharged` suites (unaffected —
numbers reproduced bit-identically before and after this PR, see §3).

## 1. Experiment

**Problem**: the 1D sidecar is an *amplitude* method — member `i` carries
`δa_i = Pᵀ(h_i − h_det)`, a deviation on a fixed spatial basis evolved by a
dissipative operator. A filling front's *arrival time* is a phase error, not
an amplitude one: it neither decays nor is expressible as a deviation on a
fixed basis. PR-10's original validation (§4 item 3 above) measured a 2–4 m
transient width at front passage the amplitude channel does not represent at
all.

**Fix** (`src/engine/uncertainty/RomPhaseCoordinate.hpp`): a per-member phase
offset `τ_i(x) = (mm_i − 1)·T̄(x)`, the same `(mm−1)` structure as the
already-validated amplitude fixed point `δa_ss = (mm−1)·b_j` — both are the
first-order response of a `1/n` conveyance law. `T̄(x)` is a **path integral**
over the deterministic flow graph (`t_e = L_e/((5/3)|u_e|)` per edge, oriented
by flow sign, accumulated downstream by a bounded max-relaxation), refreshed
every 60 s from the engine's own conduit velocity state
(`SWMMEngine::refreshRom1dTravelTime()`) — **not** a solved travel-time field.
Reconstruction in `computeQuantiles()` becomes
`h_i(x,t) = H(t − τ_i) + P·δa_i`, where `H(·)` samples a bounded ring buffer
of `h_det` planes (`DetHistoryRing`), with a past-anchored reflection
`h_ref = 2H(t) − H(t−|τ|)` for faster members (`τ<0`, a query into the future
no history buffer holds). A stagnant edge (`|u_e| < u_min`) contributes
**exactly zero** travel time, not a large/undefined value — the deliberate
answer to the `u→0` regime that broke the 2D W3 drain-to-pond fixture (H11b,
still open, out of scope here). Full design rationale, including the two
non-obvious calls (stagnation → zero not infinity; negative τ → reflection not
clamp-to-now) is in the H11 design plan
(`~/.claude/plans/please-plan-h11-implementation-woolly-pearl.md`, kept as the
O48 design record per the checklist's own routing — no separate normative doc
was written since the plan already fixes every formulation decision).

**Invariant preserved**: `τ_i = 0` exactly at `mm_i = 1` for any `T̄`
(`phaseOffset(1.0, ·) ≡ 0.0`), so every pre-H11 `DeviationForm.*`/
`SurchargeAttenuation.*` test in `test_spectral_rom1d.cpp` passes **unchanged**
— `SpectralROM1D` defaults to unphased (`setTravelTime()` never called) and
`computeQuantiles()`'s phase branch is bit-identical to the pre-H11 code path
in that state (`PhaseCoordinate.NoTravelTimeIsBitIdentical`,
`PhaseCoordinate.ZeroPerturbationExactWithPhase`). On a *steady* `h_det`
(`dh_det/dt ≈ 0`, the regime the existing saturated-window gates measure in)
the phase channel adds **exactly zero** extra width by construction
(`PhaseCoordinate.SteadyDetTrajectoryPhaseAddsNothing`) — the reason §3 below
confirms the pre-existing fixtures' numbers did not move.

**Fixture** (`fixtureInpFront()`): same 5-junction chain topology as the
free-surface fixture, but **800 m conduits** (vs. 100 m) so a filling front's
arrival time is spread over multiple minutes — resolvable at
`REPORT_STEP=60s` — instead of arriving within a single routing step;
`InitDepth=0` (a genuine dry start, not the free-surface fixture's 0.10 m) so
there is an actual front to pass; a single generous 1.0 m CIRCULAR conduit
everywhere keeps the whole run free-surface (H5's `alpha≈1` throughout),
isolating the phase channel from the attenuation channel H5 already validates
separately. **Verified by scratch probe before trusting it** (this project's
standing practice after several abandoned fixture designs elsewhere in this
file): at DWF=0.15 CMS, measured front-arrival time (`t_half`, the first
report time crossing the midpoint of a node's own `[min,max]` range) at
`rough_mult ∈ {0.8, 1.0, 1.2}`:

| node | t_half (s) at 0.8 / 1.0 / 1.2 | spread | report steps (60 s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| J4 | 1350.5 / 1590.5 / 1800.5 | 450 s | 7.5 |
| J5 | 1830.5 / 2160.5 / 2430.5 | 600 s | 10.0 |

comfortably clearing the design's own "≥2 report steps" bar. Head stayed
2.5–2.7 ft below crown at every node throughout the 2-hour window at every
`rough_mult` tried — never surcharges, confirming the fixture isolates the
phase channel from H5's attenuation channel as intended. Same 21-member
brute-force MC design as PR-10 (LHS strata of the ±20% Manning prior).

**Sample selection**: per node, from the ROM run's own deterministic
trajectory, `t_50` = first report time crossing the midpoint of that node's
`[min,max]` head range over the window; compared samples are every report
time within `±3·REPORT_STEP` of `t_50` (`frontWindowIndices()`). This targets
the actual transient instead of the whole 2-hour window, most of which is
either pre-front (flat) or fully settled (also flat, and already covered by
the saturated-regime gates above).

## 2. Results (measured)

| Cell | Coverage | Width ratio min/med/max | Samples | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `AmplitudeOnlyBaseline` (phase disabled) | 1.000 | 0.000 / **0.009** / 0.025 | 34 | *not gated — "before" measurement* |
| `PhaseCoordinate` (phase enabled) | 1.000 | 0.000 / **1.354** / 2.554 | 34 | **passes** (coverage ≥ 0.90, ratio_med ∈ [0.5, 2.0]) |

**H11 recovers essentially the whole front-passage width gap**: median width
ratio goes from **0.009** (≈150× too narrow — the amplitude channel alone
barely registers the transient at all) to **1.354** (comfortably inside the
checklist's `[0.5, 2.0]` acceptance band), on the **first run of the fixture,
with no calibration of the acceptance bounds** — the physical dials
(`celerity_factor=5/3`, `u_min`, `tau_edge_max`, `tau_total_max`) were left at
their design-time defaults (`RomPhaseCoordinate.hpp`) and never tuned against
this MC result. Both cells' `min` ratio is 0.000 at the same (J1, upstream)
sample: J1 sits at the DWF source with `T̄=0` by construction (zero cumulative
travel time), so the phase channel contributes nothing there in either cell —
expected, not a defect (see the invariant note in §1: `tbar_t=0` ⇒ every
member's reference is `h_det` regardless of `mm_i`).

## 3. Findings and scope

- **Zero drift on the pre-existing fixtures.** `RomCoverage.BandsBracket
  BruteForceMonteCarlo` (coverage 0.993, ratio_med 0.102) and
  `RomCoverageSurcharged.{Explicit,SemiImplicit}Continuity` (ratio_med 0.033 /
  1.031) reproduce **bit-identically** before and after this PR — confirming
  the §1 saturated-regime invariant empirically, not just analytically.
- **No escalation needed.** Per the checklist's hard rule 2 ("any coverage
  failure returns to design, not to threshold tuning") and this PR's own §5
  escalation note: the front-passage gate passed on the design's first
  implementation, at the design's own default physical dials, against the
  checklist's own unmodified bounds. There was no tolerance tuning, fixture
  reshaping to force green, or bound loosening at any point.
- **`AmplitudeOnlyBaseline` is deliberately ungated** (asserts only that the
  run completed) — it exists purely to state, honestly, how much of the gap
  H11 recovers, matching PR-10's own "before/after" reporting style for the
  `computeK1d` PHI fix.
- **Scope boundary**: 1D only. The 2D counterpart (`H11b`, a travel-time
  *field* rather than a path integral) remains open, with the W3
  drain-to-pond fixture (coverage 0.55–0.60, §4 of the 2D marcher-
  compatibility section above) as its ready-made failing gate — not attempted
  in this PR.
- **Coupling path untouched.** `reconstructHead()` (the 2D↔1D coupling read
  path) stays unphased by design — coupling is an instantaneous per-step
  exchange anchored on the deterministic booked flux (the W2 median-drift
  fix), and a time shift there was judged to desynchronize it for no measured
  benefit. Not measured against MC in this PR; a candidate follow-up if 2D
  coupling ever needs front-passage timing fidelity.

# Quantile-reconstruction GEMM (PR H4)

Measured 2026-08-16. Scratch benchmark (compiled standalone against the
engine dylib, per this project's established calibration-sweep pattern —
not a permanent `bench_*` target; the numbers below are the full record).
`test_spectral_rom1d.cpp`'s new `QuantileGemm` suite and
`test_2d_spectral_rom.cpp`'s new `QuantileGemm2D` suite (the latter newly
registered in `tests/unit/engine/CMakeLists.txt` — found dormant, see §3)
carry the correctness/equivalence/determinism assertions this section's
numbers rest on.

## 1. Problem

`computeQuantiles()`'s ensemble reconstruction (`ΔH[t,i] = Σ_j P[j,t]·a[i,j]`
over active modes, for every node/member pair) is an O(N·M·k) hand-rolled
triple loop — the dominant ROM cost at large N (the roadmap's own perf
table; CL-2d recorded it as the ~19% cap on that PR's own speedup).

## 2. Fix

`src/engine/uncertainty/RomQuantileGemm.hpp` (new, shared between the 1D and
2D ROMs — the matrix layouts are identical): `reconstructEnsembleGemm()`
compacts `P`/`a_ensemble` down to active-mode rows/columns only (preserving
the exact masking semantics the hand-rolled loop had — including a mode that
was active in the past and has since deactivated, which can still hold a
small nonzero "frozen" coefficient that must stay excluded, not just an
all-zero column), then computes the whole `[N × M]` reconstruction in one
`cblas_dgemm` call (Apple's Accelerate framework — zero new dependency, per
the checklist's own framing) or a portable compacted triple-loop fallback
everywhere else (`OPENSWMM_HAVE_CBLAS`, set by CMake only when the Accelerate
framework is found). Both `SpectralROM1D::computeQuantiles()` and 2D
`SpectralROM::computeQuantiles()` gained a `rom_quantile_naive` config field
(default `false`): when `true`, the original hand-rolled loop runs instead,
kept byte-for-byte, for equivalence testing — both paths are always compiled
in, never behind a build flag that would leave one of them untested.

**1D kept its full `std::sort`; 2D switched to three `std::nth_element`
selections — a deliberate, load-bearing difference, not an oversight.** PR
H10's `sortedMemberValues()` hands PR H10's `exceedanceFraction()`/
`gapModality()` the *whole* per-node row in ascending order — `gapModality()`
specifically needs the gap between *every* pair of consecutive order
statistics, which has no correct formulation without a full sort. The 2D ROM
has no equivalent consumer (`parametric_tails`'s log-normal tail fit sums
over all M members regardless of order — verified by reading the actual
implementation, not assumed), so nth_element's full O(M) → 3×O(M) saving
applies there cleanly. Implementing the checklist's literal "replace the
per-node full sort with three nth_element selections" for 1D as well would
have silently broken H10's shipped, tested modality flag — left as the naive
path's `std::sort`, unaffected by `rom_quantile_naive` either way.

## 3. Side finding: `test_2d_spectral_rom.cpp` was dormant

49 tests (`SpectralROM`, `UncertaintyEnsemble`, `SpectralROMSpatial`,
`DeviationForm2D`, `FiedlerDiagnostic` suites), present on disk since an
early mechanical-port pass, never registered in
`tests/unit/engine/CMakeLists.txt` — the exact same class of gap as PR-10's
own coverage harness before P4, `test_spectral_rom1d.cpp` before H1, and
(found the same session as this PR, on a different branch) PR11's
final-boundary-stall tests. Registered it, since it's the natural home for
this PR's 2D equivalence tests; **all 49 pre-existing tests passed
immediately** against the current codebase with zero fixes needed — a strong
independent correctness signal for the GEMM path (it now runs by default,
so passing `DeviationForm2D.*`/`SpectralROMSpatial.*`/coupling-spread tests
means GEMM reproduces the ROM's already-validated spread/median/coupling
invariants, not just the new equivalence tests written for this PR
specifically).

## 4. Benchmark (measured, not a permanent target)

**2D**: `test_corr_len_profile.cpp`'s own reference scale (N=70 structured
mesh → 9,800 triangles — that file's own documented reason for 9.8k over the
checklist's literal "≥20k": the Lanczos eigensolve at 20k/k=20 takes minutes
on this machine, and the O(quantile) cost this PR targets scales linearly in
N regardless of which N it's measured at).

**1D**: the checklist names StormCity (8k nodes) explicitly. **StormCity is
not available anywhere in this repository** — checked for a committed `.inp`,
a fixture, and a generator script; none exist (it was evidently an
external/local file used only in an earlier session, per `.memory`
references to "StormCity real-network benchmark," never committed).
**Corrected to Bellinge** (real 1020-node sewer network, already the
established production baseline for PR-10/H5/H11's own MC coverage
validation — `tests/regression/test_rom_coverage_bellinge.cpp` — rather than
a synthetic stand-in; an initial pass of this benchmark used a synthetic
8,000-node chain before this correction, which is why the node count below
differs from the checklist's literal "8k"). Driven through the real engine
exactly as `test_rom_coverage_bellinge.cpp` does (same `[UNCERTAINTY] 1D
MANNINGS_N 0.20` injection, same `REPORT_START_TIME`/rainfall-path fixes),
stepped 1 simulated hour to reach a real, non-trivial ensemble state, then
`computeQuantiles()` timed directly off the engine's own live `rom1d()`.

| Case | N | M | k | naive computeQuantiles() | GEMM computeQuantiles() | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1D (Bellinge, real network) | 1,011 active nodes | 50 | 20 | 4.67–4.70 ms | 0.443–0.454 ms | **10.3–10.6×** |
| 2D (CL-2a reference mesh) | 9,800 triangles | 50 | 20 | 109.4–111.8 ms | 15.5–15.7 ms | **7.0–7.1×** |

Each row is two independent runs of the same benchmark binary (not a single
sample) — both cases reproduced within ~3% run-to-run. Both comfortably
clear the checklist's own ≥3× gate on the quantile phase, with no tuning:
these are the numbers `RomQuantileGemm.hpp`'s first working version produced.

this project's calibration-sweep pattern); the numbers in §4 are the full
record of what was measured.

# True per-family coefficient planes (PR H7)

## 1. Problem

Two v1 approximations from the soft-rainfall (SR) arc shared one root cause:
the ROM carried exactly **one** `(spread, family)` soft-forcing channel, so a
source whose cells or gages did not all share a distribution family had to be
squeezed into a single per-member coefficient column.

- **SR-4b (MIXED grids)** used the NORMAL coefficient `z_i` for *every* cell
  and pre-scaled UNIFORM cells' spread by `max|z| / max|2u−1| ≈ 3.0` so the
  band width came out comparable. That matches the *range* but distorts the
  *marginal shape*: a UNIFORM cell's ensemble came out z-shaped (dense near
  the median, sparse in the tails) rather than evenly spaced.
- **SR-1b (multi-gage)** did not even range-match: mixed families across gages
  fell back to the first gage's family with a one-shot warning.

## 2. Fix

`SpectralROM1D::setSoftForcing()` and 2D `SpectralROM::setSoftForcing()` gained
two trailing, defaulted parameters — a second spread plane and its own family:

    setSoftForcing(loc, spread, family, soft_field,
                   spread_b /* = nullptr */, family_b /* = UNIFORM */)

`advance()` projects **both** planes (two `k·n` projections instead of one) and
each member's modal forcing becomes

    g_ij  +=  c_i · (Pᵀ·spread)_j  +  c_i^B · (Pᵀ·spread_b)_j

so each source plane keeps its own family's marginal. The caller splits a MIXED
source by family: family A's cells/gages carry their spread in `spread` with
zeros elsewhere, family B's in `spread_b` with zeros elsewhere; the two planes
are disjoint and sum to the original spread field. The SR-4b `×3.0` pre-scale
and the SR-1b first-family fallback both become unnecessary — there is no
longer a single column to squeeze onto.

**Coherence is preserved by construction, not by convention.** Both `c_i` and
`c_i^B` are drawn from the *same* `u_i = shuffledStrata(M, sample_seed + 4)`
stream — `c_i = probit(u_i)` for NORMAL/LOGNORMAL, `c_i = 2u_i − 1` for
UNIFORM. One rank per member therefore holds across families (the
`COHERENCE FULL` contract), and because the strata midpoints `(k+0.5)/M` are
symmetric about `0.5`, both columns are zero-mean and the nominal member is
nominal in *both* channels simultaneously — the deviation-form invariant
survives the second family without a special case.

**Bit-identity.** A null second plane leaves every expression adding an exact
`0.0`: the projection loop is skipped, the activation metric gains `|0|·0`, and
the per-member forcing gains `c^B·0`. Single-family callers are unchanged.

## 3. Scope guard — CORR_LEN × MIXED is refused, not approximated

The correlated-coherence paths (CL-1b/CL-1c materialized field, CL-2c reduced
basis) fold **one** family's `c_i` into the per-member projection `W_i[t]` /
`a_im` by construction; there is nowhere for a second family's coefficient to
enter without redefining that field. Rather than silently mixing families,
`setSoftForcing()` **refuses** the second plane when a spatial field is active,
leaves the ROM in a valid single-family CORR_LEN state, and reports why via the
new `softPlanesError()` accessor (empty on success). `setSoftForcingReduced()`
is single-family for the same reason and clears any previously armed second
plane. CORR_LEN × MIXED is additive future work and the error string says so.

## 4. Findings (measured)

**Marginal shapes are exact per plane, and materially different from each
other.** With the two planes aligned to orthogonal eigenmodes (plane A ∝ mode
0, plane B ∝ mode 1), each mode is fed by exactly one plane, so the marginal
claim is exact rather than approximate. Fitting each mode's member values to a
single amplitude:

| Mode | Fed by | Misfit to its own family | Misfit to the other family |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | NORMAL plane | < 1e-12 | **0.215** |
| 1 | UNIFORM plane | < 1e-12 | **0.460** |

Misfit is relative to the fitted amplitude. The cross-family figures are 20–46×
the 1e-2 assertion bar — the shape difference the pre-H7 hack was papering over
is large, not marginal.

**What a per-cell test cannot show, and why.** The spec phrased this as
"UNIFORM cells' member values uniform, not z-shaped". That cannot be asserted
on a reconstructed per-*cell* value: the ROM's eigenmodes are **global**, so
every mode sees both planes and every cell's reconstruction is a linear
combination of both coefficients. That mixing is a property of the spectral ROM
itself, not something per-family planes can or should remove. The claim that is
exactly true — and is what H7 actually fixes — is per *source plane*. The tests
assert it there, and separately verify the full two-plane decomposition against
an independent closed-form per-member reference on a realistic checkerboard
MIXED grid.

**Adding a second family plane is NOT monotone in band width — expected, not a
defect.** On a two-gage fixture where the gages cover complementary halves of
the network, the per-family band came out *narrower* than the first-family
fallback's (0.415 vs 1.000 at the widest node with equal spreads; a 58%
difference with unequal spreads). Cause: comonotone coherence gives every
member the same rank in both families, and two gages on complementary parts of
the network project onto the shared zero-mean eigenmodes with **opposing
signs**, so their contributions partially cancel. With *equal* spreads the two
projections are exactly `R_B = −R_A` on every mode and the first-family
fallback — one column over the summed spread — collapses to a near-zero band
entirely. This is a concrete demonstration of how badly the removed fallback
could misreport a multi-gage source, and the reason the regression test uses
unequal spreads (an equal-spread fixture would prove less than it appears).

## 5. Port status — ROM half live; callers ported in PR SP1 (gages) and PR SP2 (grid)

> **Update 2026-10-03.** Both callers described below are now ported against the
> two-plane API: gage-level soft rainfall in SP1 and the 2D grid `/spread` in
> SP2 (`SurfaceRouter2D::updateGridSoftSpread`). Neither carries the `×3.0`
> pre-scale or the first-family fallback. The text that follows is the original
> H7-time record of what was missing and is kept as history. Still not ported:

The `port/v2-on-marcher` line deliberately ported the ROM-side soft-forcing API
but **not** the SR-1a/SR-1b gage consumption or the SR-4b/CL-1c grid `/spread`
→ ROM path (see `.memory/current.md`, the 2026-08-03 SR-2c entry: only the
deterministic `/location` plane is read; `SimulationContext::soft_rain` does not
exist here). The two call sites the checklist asks to *delete* —
`SurfaceRouter2D::updateRainfall()`'s `sp *= 3.0` and `SWMMEngine`'s
"uses the first family" warning — therefore live only on the frozen pre-port
`origin/feature/uncertainty-sidecar` branch and are not present to remove.

**Consequence for whoever ports SR-1b/SR-4b onto this line**: port them against
the two-plane API, not the v1 hacks. Concretely, `updateRainfall()` should fill
two spread buffers keyed on `GridFileReader::family_code_now()` and pass both to
`setSoftForcing()`, instead of writing one buffer with a `×3.0` correction; and
the gage path should group gages by family into the same two planes instead of
warning and collapsing onto the first. Grids with more than two distinct
families in one file still need a third plane — the API extends the same way,
and nothing about the current shape blocks it.

### 5a. SP2 findings (2026-10-03)

- **The SR-2c re-port had silently broken gridded rainfall past its first
  timestamp.** `GridFileReader::time_next()` returns the *current* plane's own
  time when there is no next plane. The pre-port advance loop guarded on
  `spread_next() != nullptr`; the SR-2c re-port dropped that guard. Once
  simulation time passed the last plane's timestamp the loop ran off the end,
  the reader was marked exhausted, and the grid stopped forcing for the rest of
  the run, with the gages taking over silently. A single-plane grid worked only
  at t = 0. Every existing test ran at t = 0 and only checked that the grid was
  "active", so none noticed. Fixed by restoring the guard (the last plane is
  held); regression test `LastPlaneIsHeldAfterItsTimestamp`, which fails without
  the fix.
- **A 2D grid without `FORCE_LOCATION` was never opened**, on either branch,
  even though the USER_GUIDE said it would supply spread only. It is now opened
  whenever it has a `TWO_D` target; `FORCE_LOCATION` only decides whether
  `/location` overrides the gages.
- **CV spread without a `/location` plane** was zero before (it multiplied by the
  absent plane). It now uses the rainfall actually in force that step.
- **Not validated against Monte Carlo.** SP2 is checked structurally: exact plane
  mapping and conversion at router level, and that the planes reach a live 2D ROM
  (zero-perturbation baseline band is exactly 0; a spread grid makes it nonzero).
  There is no brute-force MC comparison for gridded soft rain on this line, so
  band *magnitude* from this path is unvalidated.
