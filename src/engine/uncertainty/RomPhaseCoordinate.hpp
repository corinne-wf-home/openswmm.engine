 * @brief PR H11 — per-member phase coordinate for the 1D ROM: a travel-time
 *        field `T̄(x)` and a bounded deterministic-head history ring that
 *        together let a member's reconstructed head be sampled at its own
 *        shifted time instead of the shared deterministic clock.
 *
 * @details The 1D sidecar is an AMPLITUDE method: member `i` carries
 *          `δa_i = Pᵀ(h_i − h_det)`, a deviation on a fixed spatial basis
 *          evolved by a dissipative operator. A PHASE error — a filling
 *          front arriving minutes early or late depending on Manning's n —
 *          is neither: it does not decay, and it is not expressible as an
 *          amplitude on a fixed basis. VALIDATION.md documents this as an
 *          unrepresented 2-4 m transient width at front passage.
 *
 *          Manning's law gives conveyance velocity `u ∝ 1/n`, and
 *          `LOCAL_INERTIAL_DEVIATION_OPERATOR.md` establishes the kinematic
 *          celerity `c_k = (5/3)·u`. A member with roughness multiplier
 *          `mm_i` therefore travels at `c_i = c̄/mm_i`, giving travel time
 *          `T_i = mm_i·T̄` and a per-member phase offset
 *
 *              τ_i(x) = (mm_i − 1) · T̄(x)
 *
 *          — the SAME `(mm−1)` structure as the already-validated amplitude
 *          fixed point `δa_ss = (mm−1)·b_j` (both are the first-order
 *          response of a `1/n` conveyance law). Reconstruction becomes
 *          `h_i(x,t) = h_det(x, t − τ_i) + P·δa_i`: one scalar per member,
 *          plus a bounded ring buffer of `h_det` planes.
 *
 *          `T̄(x)` is a PATH INTEGRAL over the deterministic flow graph, not
 *          a solved field: an edge contributes `t_e = L_e / ((5/3)·|u_e|)`
 *          when `|u_e| >= u_min`, oriented by the sign of its flow, and
 *          accumulated downstream by a bounded max-relaxation (handles
 *          reversal, loops, and multi-inflow nodes without a topological
 *          sort). A STAGNANT edge (`|u_e| < u_min`) contributes EXACTLY ZERO
 *          — not infinity. This is the deliberate answer to the `u -> 0`
 *          regime that broke the 2D W3 drain-to-pond fixture: the phase
 *          coordinate models a TRAVELLING kinematic signal, and where there
 *          is no conveyance-driven translation there is no phase error to
 *          model (the amplitude channel, governed by H5's attenuation, is
 *          the operative mechanism there instead). `tau_edge_max` and
 *          `tau_total_max` provide two further saturation layers so nothing
 *          grows without bound in ponding.
 *
 *          `DetHistoryRing` stores a bounded, evenly-spaced history of
 *          `h_det` planes so a member with `τ_i > 0` can sample
 *          `H(t − τ_i)`. A member with `mm_i < 1` has `τ_i < 0` — a query
 *          into the FUTURE, which no history buffer holds — resolved by a
 *          past-anchored reflection `h_ref = 2·H(t) − H(t − |τ_i|)`, the
 *          first-order forward extrapolation over the same interval using
 *          only history that already exists. On a STEADY `h_det` this
 *          reflection and the `τ > 0` sample both equal `H(t)` exactly, so
 *          the phase channel contributes NO extra width once the network
 *          has settled — the same saturated-regime invariant the existing
 *          coverage gates already measure in.
 *
 *          Both `computeTravelTime` and `DetHistoryRing` are pure / plain-
 *          array structures with no dependency on DWSolver or
 *          SimulationContext, so they unit-test against hand-built fixtures
 *          independent of the real hydraulics.

 * Orientation: `up = (vel_signed[e] >= 0) ? n1[e] : n2[e]`, `dn` the other
