 * @brief Spectral reduced-order model for uncertainty propagation in 1D
 *        pipe network routing.
 *
 * @details Analogous to SpectralROM (2D surface), but operates on the node
 *          head field of a 1D pipe network represented by GraphEigenBasis.
 *
 *          DEVIATION FORM (see docs/uncertainty/DEVIATION_FORM.md): the state
 *          per member i is the modal projection of the deviation from the
 *          deterministic trajectory, δa_i = P^T (h_i − h_det), evolving as
 *
 *            d(δa_ij)/dt = −(λ_j·K1d/mm_i)·δa_ij
 *                          − λ_j·K1d·(1/mm_i − 1)·b_j(t)   (Manning sensitivity)
 *                          + (rm_i − 1)·r_j(t)             (forcing sensitivity)
 *
 *          where:
 *            λ_j    = j-th eigenvalue of the network Laplacian
 *            K1d    = effective 1D conductance scale (1/s after L² normalization)
 *            mm_i   = member i Manning multiplier, rm_i = runoff multiplier
 *            b_j(t) = P[:,j]^T · h_det   (deterministic head projection)
 *            r_j(t) = P[:,j]^T · runoff_per_node
 *
 *          The nominal member (mm = rm = 1) has zero forcing and zero deviation
 *          forever, so the median tracks the deterministic run by construction
 *          and no reseeding is ever required (spread is never collapsed).
 *
 *          Per-member runoff from RunoffEnsemble can be injected via
 *          setEnsembleRunoff(): (rm_i − 1) is replaced by (rate_i/mean − 1).

     * @brief Supply a location/spread forcing pair for soft rainfall / inflow.
     *
     * The deterministic forcing projection uses @p loc (when non-null); the
     * uncertainty sensitivity uses c_i * (P^T spread) with the per-member
     * coefficient c_i selected by @p family (fixed at initialize()):
     *   - NORMAL / LOGNORMAL : c_i = z_i = probit(u_i)   (location-scale delta)
     *   - UNIFORM            : c_i = 2*u_i - 1            (half-range band)
     * so member i's realized forcing is loc + c_i * spread. For LOGNORMAL the
     * caller passes spread = sigma_log * loc (delta linearization, §4.3).
     *
     * Both pointers are NON-OWNING and must remain valid until changed or
     * cleared. Passing nullptr for @p spread disables the soft spread path.
     *
     * @param soft_field Optional per-member spatial coefficient field
     *        (`COHERENCE CORR_LEN`, CL-1b). NON-OWNING; must outlive the ROM
     *        or be cleared. When null (default) or non-spatial, the comonotone
     *        scalar `c_i` path is used and the result is bit-identical to the
     *        pre-CL-1b behaviour. When spatial, member i's per-mode forcing
     *        sensitivity becomes `Σ_t P_j[t]·spread[t]·W_i[t]` (a per-member
     *        projection) in place of the scalar `c_i · (P^T spread)_j`. The
     *        field's `n_cells` must equal the number of active ROM nodes and
     *        `n_members` must equal n_ensemble; its per-node column mean over
     *        members must equal mean_i(c_i) so q50 still tracks the
     *        deterministic answer (checked by assertion in debug builds).
     *
     * @param spread_b Optional SECOND spread plane carrying a DIFFERENT
     *        distribution family (PR H7). Null (default) leaves the ROM
     *        single-family and bit-identical to the pre-H7 behaviour. When
     *        non-null the member forcing sensitivity becomes
     *
     *            c_i·(Pᵀ·spread)_j  +  c_i^B·(Pᵀ·spread_b)_j
     *
     *        i.e. two projections per advance, one per family, instead of one
     *        family's coefficient applied to a range-matched single plane.
     *        NON-OWNING, same lifetime contract as @p spread. Callers split a
     *        MIXED source by family: cells/gages of family A go in @p spread
     *        (zero elsewhere), family B's go in @p spread_b (zero elsewhere).
     * @param family_b Family selecting c_i^B. Both coefficients derive from
     *        the SAME `u_i = shuffledStrata(M, sample_seed+4)` stream, so one
     *        rank per member holds across families — the COHERENCE FULL
     *        contract — and the nominal member is nominal in both channels
     *        simultaneously.
     *
     * @note Scope guard (PR H7): a second plane is REFUSED when @p soft_field
     *       is spatial (`COHERENCE CORR_LEN`), because the correlated path
     *       carries one coefficient family per source by construction. The
     *       call still succeeds as a single-family call and softPlanesError()
     *       returns a non-empty explanation; CORR_LEN × MIXED is additive
     *       future work.
