 * @brief Reduced k×k deviation operator M = Pᵀ·L_op·P for the 2D surface ROM.
 *
 * @details The surface ROM evolves member deviations δa = Pᵀ(h − h_det) on the
 *          fixed mesh eigenbasis P. This class assembles the full-mesh linear
 *          operator L_op governing d(δh)/dt = −L_op·δh and Galerkin-projects it
 *          once onto P, giving a small dense matrix M (k×k, units 1/s) that the
 *          ROM integrates exactly with a matrix exponential:
 *
 *              δa(t+Δt) = exp(−M·Δt)·δa(t) + φ₁(−M·Δt)·Δt·g
 *
 *          Every physics rung is just what is assembled into M — one code
 *          path, a dial:
 *
 *          - **diffusion, flow-aligned anisotropic**: edge conductance
 *            D_edge = D_scale·(α∥·cos²θ + α⊥·sin²θ), where θ is the angle
 *            between the edge (centroid line) and the local flow direction.
 *            α∥ = α⊥ = 1 is the isotropic baseline; the local-inertial
 *            linearization (LOCAL_INERTIAL_DEVIATION_OPERATOR.md §5) gives the
 *            starting points α∥ ≈ 0.31·K/D_scale, α⊥ ≈ 1.0·K/D_scale — Manning
 *            friction uses the flow-vector magnitude, so the linearized
 *            friction rate is 2r_f streamwise but r_f transverse.
 *          - **advection (skew)**: first-order upwind transport at celerity
 *            c⃗ = c_factor·u⃗ (c_factor = 5/3 is the Manning kinematic-wave
 *            celerity). c_factor = 0 disables. This is the term a symmetric
 *            Laplacian cannot carry: it makes deviation bands travel with the
 *            flow rather than only spread.
 *
 *          **Units convention — physical, not graph.** L_op is the
 *          finite-volume operator, i.e. every face flux is divided by the cell
 *          area, so M is in true 1/s with D_scale in m²/s. This differs from
 *          the ROM's historical diagonal path, which uses K_eff·λ with λ the
 *          eigenvalues of the *graph* Laplacian (conductance len/d, no 1/A) —
 *          a convention that silently carries an O(cell-size²) scale factor.
 *          The W3 marcher-MC harness measures both; the calibrated constants
 *          absorb any residual scale.
 *
 *          M reads only mesh geometry, the eigenbasis, and readable state
 *          (depth weights, cell velocity). It is reassembled on the ROM's
 *          basis-update cadence — when the flow field has moved materially —
 *          never per step, and never triggers a re-eigensolve: P stays fixed.
 *
 *          Cost: assemble O(nnz·k + n·k²); propagate O(k³) per member per
 *          batch via a (k+1)² augmented matrix exponential — microseconds at
 *          the ROM's k ≈ 24.

     * @brief Assemble M = Pᵀ·L_op·P from mesh geometry, flow state and dials.
     *
     * @param mesh    Mesh (topology finalized).
     * @param basis   Built eigenbasis; P defines the projection and k.
     * @param D_scale Diffusivity scale (m²/s). Typically the Manning
     *                diffusion-wave value h̄^{5/3}/(2·n̄·√S̄).
     * @param h_cell  Optional per-cell depth weights; when non-null, each edge
     *                conductance is multiplied by the harmonic mean of
     *                (h/h̄)^{5/3} of its two cells (the operator-level version
     *                of the diagonal path's Rayleigh weighting). Null = uniform.
     * @param cell_u  Optional per-cell velocity x (m/s). Null (either) =
     *                no flow direction: isotropic mean conductance, no
     *                advection regardless of c_factor.
     * @param cell_v  Optional per-cell velocity y (m/s).
     * @param ground_w Optional per-cell open-boundary grounding conductance
     *                (dimensionless len/d convention, matching
     *                MeshEigenBasis::build). Adds D_scale·⟨α⟩·ground_w/A to
     *                the cell's diagonal — deviations flush through open
     *                boundaries, so the operator must not be pure Neumann
     *                wherever the basis was grounded. Use the SAME weights as
     *                the basis build: an ungrounded operator on a grounded
     *                basis leaves the drain mode undamped (spurious spread
     *                growth), and the reverse hides the drain mode entirely.
     * @param cond_mult Optional per-cell conductance multiplier (PR H15):
     *                the local inverse Manning multiplier 1/W_n(t). Both the
     *                friction diffusivity and the kinematic celerity scale
     *                as 1/n, so it multiplies each edge's diffusive
     *                conductance by the harmonic mean of its two cells'
     *                values (series conductance, the same convention as the
     *                depth weighting), each cell's velocity before the face
     *                average (so advection scales too), and the cell's
     *                grounding term. A uniform value c reproduces c·M of the
     *                unscaled assembly; null is bit-identical to all-ones.
     *                This is what lets one operator be assembled PER MEMBER
     *                for a spatially correlated Manning field
     *                (SpectralROM::setReducedOperatorPerMember).
     * @return true on success (basis ready, mesh non-degenerate).
