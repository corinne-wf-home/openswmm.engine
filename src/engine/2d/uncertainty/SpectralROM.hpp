 * @brief Spectral reduced-order model (ROM) for uncertainty propagation in 2D
 *        surface routing.
 *
 * @details Runs an M-member ensemble alongside the deterministic CVODE simulation
 *          to produce calibrated prediction intervals at near-zero marginal cost.
 *
 *          DEVIATION FORM (see docs/uncertainty/DEVIATION_FORM.md): the state per
 *          member i is the modal projection of the deviation from the deterministic
 *          CVODE depth field, δa_i = P^T (h_i − h_det), evolving as
 *
 *            d(δa_ij)/dt = −(λ_j·keff_ji)·δa_ij
 *                          − λ_j·(keff_ji − keff_j^nom)·b_j(t)   (Manning sensitivity)
 *                          + (f_ij − r_coarse[j])               (forcing sensitivity)
 *
 *          where keff_ji is the per-member depth-weighted mode conductance,
 *          keff_j^nom = keff_modes_[j] the mm=1 nominal, b_j = P[:,j]^T·h_det, and
 *          f_ij the member rainfall forcing (r_coarse[j] its mm=rm=1 nominal).
 *
 *          The nominal member (mm=rm=1) has zero forcing and zero deviation forever,
 *          so the median tracks the deterministic run by construction. The ODE is
 *          solved exactly via an exponential integrator — O(M·k) per advance.
 *
 *          After each advance, `computeQuantiles(h_det)` reconstructs per-cell depth
 *          as h_det + P·δa (clamped at 0) and produces 5/50/95 percentile fields.
 *
 * @note Requires a MeshEigenBasis that built successfully (num_kept > 0).

     * exact matrix exponential instead of the per-mode diagonal decay
     * λ_j·keff_j/mm_i. The Manning-sensitivity forcing generalizes to
     * −(1/mm_i − 1)·M·b; every other forcing term (rainfall, soft, registered
     * vectors) enters g_i unchanged. Dividing the whole operator by mm is
     * consistent: the Manning multiplier scales n, and both the friction
     * diffusivity and the kinematic celerity scale as 1/n, so the operator
     * scales as a whole.
     *
     * The matrix is typically assembled by DeviationOperator2D — isotropic,
     * flow-aligned anisotropic, and advective operators differ only in what
     * was assembled — and is reassembled on the basis-update cadence, never
     * per step.

     * Notes:
     * - Call after initialize(); the dimension must equal n_kept (throws).
     * - h_cell passed to advance() is IGNORED on this path: depth weighting
     *   belongs in the assembly, where it acts on edge conductances rather
     *   than through the diagonal Rayleigh-quotient approximation.
     * - The per-member spatial Manning field (spatial_mannings) cannot be
     *   represented by one shared M. Without per-member operators advance()
     *   falls back to the diagonal path in that configuration; with them
     *   (setReducedOperatorPerMember, PR H15) it integrates each member on
     *   its own operator.
